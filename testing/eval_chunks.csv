17th century
In 1641, during the
Thirty Years' War, the Holy Roman Emperor and Margrave of Moravia
Ferdinand III
ordered the permanent relocation of the diet, court, and the land tables from Olomouc to Brno, as Olomouc's
Collegium Nordicum
made it one of the primary targets of Swedish armies.
In 1642 Olomouc surrendered to the
Swedish Army, which occupied it for eight years.
Meanwhile, Brno, as the only Moravian city which, under the leadership of
Jean-Louis Raduit de Souches, succeeded in defending itself from the Swedes under General
Lennart Torstenson, served as the sole capital of the Margraviate of Moravia. After the end of the Thirty Years' War in 1648, Brno retained its status as the sole capital. This was later confirmed by the Holy Roman Emperor
Joseph II
in 1782, and again in 1849 by the Moravian constitution.
Today, the Moravian Land Tables are stored in the
Moravian Regional Archive, and are included among the national cultural sights of the Czech Republic.
During the 17th century
Špilberk Castle
was rebuilt as a huge baroque
citadel.
Brno was besieged by the
Prussian Army
in 1742 under the leadership of
Frederick the Great, but the siege was ultimately unsuccessful. In 1777 the
bishopric of Brno
was established by the
Catholic Church;
Mathias Franz Graf von Chorinsky Freiherr von Ledske
was the first Bishop.
19th century
In December 1805 the
Battle of Austerlitz
was fought near the city; the battle is also known as the ""Battle of the Three Emperors"". Brno itself was not involved with the battle, but the French Emperor
Napoleon Bonaparte
spent several nights here at that time, and again in 1809.
In 1839 the first train arrived in Brno from Vienna; this was the beginning of
rail transport in what is now the Czech Republic.
In the years 1859–1864 the city fortifications were almost completely removed. In 1869 a
horsecar
service started to operate in Brno, the first
tram service
in what would later become the Czech Republic.

Climate
Under the
Köppen climate classification, Brno has an
oceanic climate (Cfb) for −3 °C original isoterm, but near of the (−2.5 °C average temperature in January, month most cold) or include by updated classification in
humid continental climate (Dfb) with cold winters and warm to hot summers.
However, in the last 20 years the temperature has increased, and summer days with temperature above 30 °C (86 °F) are quite common.
The average temperature is 9.4 °C (49 °F), the average annual precipitation is about 505 mm (19.88 in), the average number of precipitation days is 150, the average annual sunshine is 1,771 hours, and the prevailing wind direction is northwest.
The weather box below shows average data between years 1961 and 1990.
Its height above sea level varies from 190 m (623 ft) to 497 m (1,631 ft).
The highest peak in the municipal area is the Kopeček Hill (479 m (1,572 ft)), and the highest point overall lies in
Útěchov
on the border with the municipality of
Vranov.
Festivals
The biggest festival in Brno is the
fireworks
competition festival, Ignis Brunensis (Latin for ""Flame of Brno""), held annually in June, part of the ""Brno – City in the Centre of Europe"" festival.
Ignis Brunensis is the biggest show of its kind in Central Europe, usually attracting 100,000–200,000 visitors to each display.
The international film festival
Cinema Mundi
screens about 60 films competing for
Oscar
nomination in the category of Best Foreign Language Film.
Theatre World Brno is another international festival held annually in the city, in which Brno theatres and the city centre stage around 100 performances by national and foreign ensembles. Other festivals held regularly in Brno include the International Music Festival Brno, the Spilberk International Music Festival, and the Summer Shakespeare Festival.
Every September, Brno hosts a wine festival, Slavnosti vína, to celebrate the harvest in the surrounding
wine-producing
region.",static

Local legends
There are several legends connected with the City of Brno. One of the best known is the Legend of the Brno Dragon.
According to this legend, a terrible creature was terrorizing the citizens of Brno. The people had never seen this animal before, so they called it a dragon. They lived in fear of the dragon until one citizen managed to kill the monster by tricking it into eating a carcass filled with lime. In reality the dragon was a crocodile, the preserved body of which is now displayed at the entrance of the
Old Town Hall. Crocodile and dragon motifs are common in Brno. A crocodile (Czech:
krokodýl) is the local stuffed baguette, and the city radio station is known as Radio Krokodýl. The local
baseball
team is named
Draci Brno (English:
Brno Dragons) and the local rugby club is named
RC Dragon Brno. There is also a local
American football
team called the
Brno Alligators. An
Intercity
train connecting Brno and
Prague
is called Brněnský drak (English:
The Brno dragon).
Next to the ""dragon"" at the Old Town Hall is the town's second well-known emblem, a wagon wheel made from a tree found and cut down 50 miles from the city. According to the legend, a local man made a wager that he could fell the tree, make a wheel out of it, and roll the wheel to the City of Brno, all within a single day. Since the achievement was deemed to be impossible by normal human means, the man was believed to have called on the devil for assistance, and died in poverty as a result.
Another local legend relates to the siege of the city by Swedish forces in 1645. The locals and the Swedish army were in a stalemate, and the Swedish general declared that he would withdraw if his army had not won by noon. The bell ringer at Petrov Cathedral tricked him by ringing the bell an hour early, and keeping his word, the general and his army left. As a historic tribute to the event, the bell at Petrov Cathedral still rings for noon an hour earlier, at 11 o'clock. At this time, the Brno astronomical clock also releases a glass ball as a souvenir.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brno,"Brno

In the early 11th century Brno was established as a castle of a non-ruling prince from the
House of Přemyslid, and Brno became one of the centres of Moravia along with
Olomouc
and
Znojmo. Brno was first mentioned in Cosmas'
Chronica Boemorum
dated to the year 1091, when Bohemian king
Vratislaus II
besieged his brother
Conrad
at Brno castle.
In the mid 11th century, Moravia was divided into three separate territories; each had its own ruler, coming from the
Přemyslids
dynasty, but independent of the other two, and subordinate only to the
Bohemian
ruler in
Prague. The seats of these rulers and thus the ""capitals"" of these territories were the castles and towns of Brno, Olomouc, and
Znojmo. In the late 12th century, Moravia began to reunify, forming the
Margraviate of Moravia. From then until the mid of the 17th century, it was not clear which town should be the capital of Moravia. Political power was divided between Brno and Olomouc, but Znojmo also played an important role. The Moravian Diet, the Moravian Land Tables, and the Moravian Land Court were all seated in both cities at once.
However, Brno was the official seat of the Moravian Margraves (rulers of Moravia), and later its geographical position closer to
Vienna
also became important. Otherwise, until 1642 Olomouc had a larger population than Brno, and was the seat of the only
Roman Catholic
diocese
in Moravia.
In 1243 Brno was granted the large and small city privileges
by the King, and was thus recognized as a royal city. As throughout Eastern Central Europe, the granting of city privileges was connected with
immigration from German-speaking lands. In 1324 Queen
Elisabeth Richeza of Poland
founded the
Basilica of the Assumption of Our Lady, which now houses her grave.
In the 14th century, Brno became one of the centres for the Moravian regional assemblies, whose meetings alternated between Brno and Olomouc.
These assemblies made political, legal, and financial decisions. Brno and Olomouc were also the seats of the Land Court and the
Moravian Land Tables, thus they were the two most important cities in Moravia. From the mid 14th century to the early 15th century, Špilberk Castle had served as the permanent seat of the Margraves of Moravia; one of them was elected the
King of the Romans. Brno was besieged in 1428 and again in 1430 by the
Hussites
during the
Hussite Wars. Both attempts to conquer the city failed.",static
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brno,"Brno

20th century and Greater Brno
Around 1900 Brno, which consisted in administrative terms only of the central city area until 1918, had a predominantly
German-speaking population (63%), as opposed to the suburbs, which were predominantly Czech-speaking.
Life in the city was therefore bilingual, and what was called in German ""Brünnerisch"" was a mixed idiom containing elements from both languages.
In 1919, after
World War I, two neighbouring towns, Královo Pole and Husovice, and 21 other municipalities were annexed to Brno, creating Greater Brno (Czech:
Velké Brno). This was done to dilute the German-speaking majority of close to 55,000
by the addition of the Czech communities of the city's neighborhood. Included in the German-speaking group were almost all of the 12,000 Jewish inhabitants, including several of the city's better known personalities, who made a substantial contribution to the city's cultural life.
Greater Brno was almost seven times larger, with a population of about 222,000 – before that Brno had about 130,000 inhabitants.
In 1921 Brno became the capital of the Land of Moravia (Czech: země Moravská ). Seven years later, Brno became the capital of the Land of Moravia-Silesia (Czech: země Moravskoslezská ).
In 1930, 200,000 inhabitants declared themselves to be of Czech, and some 52,000 of German nationality, in both cases including the respective Jewish citizens.
During the
German occupation of the Czech lands
between 1939 and 1945, all Czech universities were closed by the Nazis, including those in Brno. The
Faculty of Law
became the headquarters of the
Gestapo, and the university hall of residence was used as a prison. About 35,000 Czechs and some American and British
prisoners of war
were imprisoned and tortured there; about 800 civilians were executed or died.
Executions were public.
The Nazis also operated a
subcamp
of the
Auschwitz concentration camp, which held mostly Polish prisoners, an internment camp for
Romani people
in the city, and a

Between 1941 and 1942, transports
from Brno deported 10,081 Jews to
Theresienstadt (Terezín) concentration camp. At least another 960 people, mostly of
mixed race, followed in 1943 and 1944. After Terezín, many of them were sent to
Auschwitz concentration camp, Minsk Ghetto, Rejowiec
and other
ghettos
and
concentration camps. Although Terezín was not an
extermination camp, 995 people transported from Brno died there. Only 1,033 people returned after the war.
Industrial facilities such as the
Československá zbrojovka
arms factory and the Zweigwerk
aircraft engine
factory (which became Zbrojovka's subsidiary
Zetor
after the war) and the city centre were targeted by several
Allied
bombardment
campaigns between 1944 and 1945. The air strikes and later artillery fire killed some 1,200 people and destroyed 1,278 buildings.
After the city's occupation by the
Red Army
on 26 April 1945
and the end of the
war, ethnic German residents were
expelled. In the
Brno death march, beginning on 31 May 1945, about 27,000 German inhabitants of Brno were marched 64 kilometres (40 miles) to the Austrian border. According to testimony collected by German sources, about 5,200 of them died during the march.
Later estimates by Czech sources put the death toll at about 1,700, with most deaths due to an epidemic of
shigellosis.
After the reestablishment of an
independent Czechoslovak state
after
World War II, Prime Minister
Edvard Beneš
delivered a speech in Brno demanding the
expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia. Shortly afterwards, 20,000 ethnic Germans from the city were expelled into
Allied-occupied Austria.
After the
1948 Czechoslovak coup d'état, the
Czechoslovak Socialist Republic
abolished Moravian autonomy and Brno thus ceased to be the capital of Moravia.
Since then Moravia has been divided into administrative regions, with Brno the administrative centre of the
South Moravian Region.
In 1960s and 1970s, large panel
housing estates
were built in border districts, such as Bohunice, Líšeň, Bystrc and Vinohrady. During the communist era, most of the workforce was employed in industry, mainly machinery.
After 1989, part of the workforce switched from industry to services, and Brno became the IT centre of the Czech Republic. Nevertheless, new industrial zones were built at the edge of the city, such as Černovická terasa in the east of the city.
Geography",static
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brno,"Brno

Brno is located in the southeastern part of the Czech Republic, at the confluence of the
Svitava
and
Svratka
rivers, and there are also several brooks flowing through it, including the Veverka, Ponávka, and Říčka. The Svratka River flows through the city for about 29 km (18 mi), and the Svitava River cuts a 13 km (8 mi) path through the city.
Brno is situated at the crossroads of ancient trade routes which have joined northern and southern European civilizations for centuries, and is a part of the
Danube basin
region. The city is historically connected with Vienna, which lies 110 km (68 mi) to the south.
Brno is 21.5 km (13.4 mi) across, measured from east to west, and its total area is 230 km
2 (89 sq mi).
Within the city limits are the
Brno Reservoir, several ponds, and other standing bodies of water, such as the
reservoirs
in the Marian Valley
and the Žebětín Pond. Brno is surrounded by wooded hills on three sides; about 6,379 ha (15,763 acres) of the area of the city is forest, 28% of the total. Due to its location between the
Bohemian-Moravian Highlands
and the
Southern Moravian lowlands (Dyje-Svratka Vale), Brno has a moderate climate.
Compared to other cities in the country, Brno has a very high air quality, which is ensured by a good natural circulation of air; no severe storms or similar natural disasters have ever been recorded in the city.",static

cadastral areas. The ""Brno-City District"" and ""Brno-Country District"" are not to be confused with the ""city districts"" of Brno.
The city districts of Brno vary widely in their size by both population and area. The most populated city district of Brno is
Brno-Centre, which has over 91,000 residents, and the least populated are
Brno-Ořešín
and
Brno-Útěchov, with about 500 residents. By area, the largest district is

Demographics",static
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brno,"Brno

According to the 2021 census, Brno had 398,510 inhabitants.
The largest ethnic groups reported (without options to choose between) were
Czechs (51.6%), Moravians (18.7%), Slovaks (1.5%), Ukrainians (0.9%), Vietnamese (0.4%), and
Poles (0.2%). 23.7% of inhabitants did not write any nationality. In the 2001 census, when the most common nationalities were list to choose between, 76.1% were Czechs and 18.7% Moravians (94.8% Czechs in the broader sense).
Brno experienced its largest increases in population during the 19th century at the time of the
Industrial Revolution, and in 1919 due to a merger with surrounding municipalities.
Culture
The city spends about 30 million euro every year on culture. A vibrant university city with about 60,000 students, Brno is home to many museums, theatres and other cultural institutions, and also hosts a number of festivals and other cultural events.
Since the 1990s Brno has experienced a great cultural ""rebirth"": façades of historical monuments are being repaired and various exhibitions, shows, etc., are being established or extended. In 2007 a summit of 15 presidents of EU Member States was held in Brno.
Despite its urban character, some of the city districts still preserve traditional Moravian folklore, including folk festivals with traditional Moravian costumes, Moravian wines, folk music and dances. Unlike smaller municipalities, in Brno annual traditional Moravian folk festivals are held in several city districts, including
Židenice, Líšeň, and
Ivanovice.

Sights
Brno has hundreds of historical sights, including one designated a
World Heritage Site
by
UNESCO, and eight monuments listed among the national cultural heritage of the Czech Republic.
Most of the main sights of Brno are situated in the historical centre. The city has the third largest historic preservation zone in the Czech Republic, the largest one being in the Czech capital
Prague. However, there is a considerable difference in the number of historical preservation zones of both cities. While Brno has 484 legally protected sites, Prague has as many as 1,330.
Špilberk Castle, originally a royal castle founded in the 13th century, was from the 17th century a fortress and feared prison (e.g.
Carbonari). Today it is one of the city's principal monuments.
Another key landmark is the
Cathedral of St. Peter and Paul, built during the 14th and 15th centuries in place of an 11th-century chapel.
Its present form with two
neo-Gothic
towers was completed in 1909. The other large castle near the city is
Veveří Castle.
The
Abbey of Saint Thomas
was the site of
Gregor Mendel
's experiments establishing the new science of
genetics. The
Church of Saint Tomas
houses the tomb of its founder, John Henry
and his son
Jobst of Moravia, Margraves of Moravia. The
Basilica of the Assumption of Our Lady
houses the grave of its founder Queen
Elisabeth Richeza. The
Church of Saint James
is one of the best preserved and most spectacular
Gothic
churches in Brno.
Brno Ossuary
is the second largest
ossuary
in Europe, after the
Catacombs of Paris. Another ossuary is the
Capuchin crypt, with
mummies
of Capuchin monks and some of the notable people of their era, including architect
Mořic Grimm
and the mercenary leader
Baron Trenk.
The
Labyrinth
under
Zelný trh (English:
Cabbage market), a system of underground corridors and cellars dating back to the Middle Ages, has been recently opened to the public. These cellars have been used mainly for storing food, maturing beer and wine, and as wartime shelters. Originally, they were not interconnected as they are now – this happened later during the reconstruction in 2009.",static

Brno is home to a functionalist Synagogue and the largest
Jewish cemetery
in Moravia. A Jewish population lived in Brno as early as the 13th century, and remnants of tombstones can be traced back to as early as 1349.
The functionalist synagogue was built between 1934 and 1936.
While the Brno Jewish community numbered 12,000 in 1938, only 1,000 survived
Nazi
persecution during Germany's occupation in
World War II.
Today, the cemetery and synagogue are again maintained by a Brno Jewish community. The only Czech
mosque, founded in 1998, is also located in Brno.
The era between the world wars saw a building boom to the city, leaving it with many
modern
and especially
functionalist
buildings, the most celebrated being
Villa Tugendhat, designed by architect
Ludwig Mies van der Rohe
in the 1920s for the wealthy family of
Fritz Tugendhat, and finished in 1930. It was designated a
World Heritage Site
by
UNESCO
in 2001.
Another renowned architect who significantly shaped Brno was
Arnošt Wiesner.
Other functionalist buildings include the
Avion Hotel
and
Morava Palace. The
Brno Exhibition Centre
is the city's main attraction for international business visitors, visited by over one million visitors each year, and hosting over 40 professional trade fairs and business conferences.
Lužánky
is the oldest public park in the Czech Republic, established in the late 18th century by the emperor of the
Austro-Hungarian Empire.
Denis Gardens
were founded in the early 19th century and were the first public park in the present-day Czech Republic founded by public authorities.
Špilberk Park
is classified as a national cultural sight of the Czech Republic, as a unique piece of landscape architecture.
One of Brno's more recent additions is the
Brno astronomical clock.

Theatres
Brno has a long theatre tradition. Brno has the oldest theatre building in Central Europe, the
Reduta Theatre
on
Zelný trh.
The first theatre plays in Brno probably took place in the 1660s in the
City Tavern, today's Reduta Theatre; however, the first theatre with
boxes
was built in this complex in 1733.
The first documented professional Czech performance took place in 1767, again in the Reduta Theatre; the play was called
Zamilovaný ponocný (English:
Watchman in Love) and was performed by the
Venice Theatre Company. The same year, Mozart
performed in the theatre with his elder sister Anna Maria (Nannerl).
In that year the Mozart family spent Christmas in Brno, and their visit is commemorated by a statue of Mozart as a child in front of the Reduta Theatre. The theatre's
Mozart Hall
was also named after him.
The
Národní divadlo v Brně (English:
National Theatre of Brno; NdB) is the leading producer of
opera, drama, and
ballet
in the city of Brno. The first permanent seat of NdB was established in 1884, and today this institution owns the
Mahen Theatre, built in 1882, Janáček Theatre, built in 1965, and the
Reduta Theatre.
The composer
Leoš Janáček
is also connected with the National Theatre of Brno.
The Mahen Theatre was the first theatre building in Europe to be illuminated by
Thomas Edison
's
electric light bulbs; at that time it was a completely new invention and there were no power plants built in the city, so a small steam power plant was built nearby just to power the theatre, and Edison came to Brno in 1911 to see it.
The most commercially successful theatre in Brno is the
Brno City Theatre, founded in 1945;
its performances are usually sold out. They also stage about 150 performances abroad every year.
The theatre's repertoire consists primarily of musical and dramatic shows.
There are a variety of smaller theatres in Brno, including the
Bolek Polivka
Theatre, the Goose on a String Theatre (""Divadlo Husa na provázku""), HaDivadlo, Radost Puppet Theatre (""loutkové divadlo Radost""), and Polárka Theatre.
The Mahen Theatre was originally called the City Theatre, and until 1918 it performed exclusively in German and was not part of the National Theatre of Brno. Between 1971 and 1978, some plays were performed at the
Brno Exhibition Centre
due to reconstruction of the Mahen Theatre.",static

Museums, libraries and galleries
The most significant museum in Brno is the
Moravian Museum, the largest museum in Moravia and the second largest in the Czech Republic.
The museum was founded in 1817 and its collections include over 6 million pieces.
The biggest public library in Brno is the
Moravian Library, the second largest library in the Czech Republic with around 4 million volumes.
The biggest gallery in Brno is the
Moravian Gallery, again the second largest institution of its kind in the Czech Republic and the biggest in Moravia.
One section of the Moravian Museum, the
Anthropos Pavilion, is related to the oldest history of mankind and prehistoric Europe.
Brno also has a Technical Museum, the largest in Moravia and one of the largest in Czech Republic. The permanent exhibitions chart the advance of science and technology, accompanied by various lifelike models and restored machines. The museum also hosts short-term exhibitions of many different points of interest.
In 2016 the Vašulka Kitchen Brno (VKB) was established in Brno for research, artistic experiment and informal education in the field of new media art. Housed in the Brno House of Arts, it consists of the archive of
Steina and Woody Vasulka
’ work and presents a permanent exhibition of their selected works.
Education
In 2019, 62,000 students were enrolled in Brno's higher education institutions.
The city is also home to a number of
research and development
institutions, including the
Central European Institute of Technology (CEITEC), and the
International Clinical Research Center (ICRC).
With over 40,000 students, Masaryk University
is the largest university in Brno and the second biggest in the Czech Republic.
It consists of nine faculties, with more than 190 departments, institutes, and clinics.
The
Brno University of Technology
was established in 1899, and is now among the biggest technical universities in the Czech Republic with over 20,000 students.
Viktor Kaplan, inventor of the
Kaplan turbine, spent nearly 30 years at the
German Technical University in Brno, which ceased to exist in 1945, its property transferred to Brno University of Technology.
Mendel University, named after the founder of genetics
Gregor Mendel, who developed his
revolutionary scientific theories
in Brno, has roughly 10,000 students.",static

Janáček Academy of Music and Performing Arts, named after
Leoš Janáček, was founded in 1947 and is one of two academies of music and drama in the Czech Republic.
It holds the annual
Leoš Janáček Competition.
Economy
Since 1990, many companies created or spun off as part of privatization from former national enterprises have disappeared.
Before 1990, engineering companies were very important in Brno; since then, the city's economy has largely reoriented itself towards light industry, logistics, and services. The city later gained importance in other fields of
engineering, especially in
software development. After 2000, foreign technology companies began establishing their branches in Brno, and many Czech companies with local or global reach were also founded here.
Companies operating in Brno include
Gen Digital (one of the headquarters, brand
AVG Technologies
still used), Kyndryl (Client Innovation Centre), AT&T, Honeywell (Global Design Center), Siemens, Red Hat (Czech headquarters),, an office of
Zebra Technologies, and formerly
Silicon Graphics International (Czech headquarters).
In recent years, the quaternary sector of the economy, i.e., activities in science, research, and education, has also begun to develop in Brno. Examples include AdMaS (Advanced Materials, Structures, and Technologies) or CETOCOEN (Center for Research on Toxic Substances in the Environment).
The city cultivates this sector via supporting organisations such as the
South Moravian Innovation Centre
and the
VUT
Technology Incubator.
Sport
The city has a long association with
motor racing; among other events, the
Masaryk Circuit
has hosted the
Moto GP
championship since 1965. The annual
Czech Republic motorcycle Grand Prix, the most famous motor race in the Czech Republic, has been held in the city since 1950. Since 1968, Brno has been a permanent fixture on the
European Touring Car Championship (ETCC) series.",static

Track
and
road cycling
have a long history in Brno. The first track races took place here in 1889, and the
velodrome
in Brno ranks among the
oldest velodromes
in the world. In 1969 Brno hosted the
UCI Track Cycling World Championships
and
UCI Road World Championships
for amateurs, in 1981 the UCI Track Cycling World Championships
and
in 2001 the UEC European Track Championships
for the U23 category. There are two traditional cycling teams:
TJ Favorit Brno
and
Dukla Brno.
The
2010 FIBA World Championship for Women
was played in Brno's
Arena Vodova, with the Czech squad taking the silver medal.
There is a horse-race course at Brno-Dvorská and an aeroclub airport in
Medlánky. Several sports clubs represent the city in the various Czech leagues, including
FC Zbrojovka Brno (football), HC Kometa Brno (ice hockey), KP Brno (handball), BC Brno (basketball, men) and
BK Brno (women), four
baseball
teams (Draci Brno, Hroši Brno, VSK Technika Brno, MZLU Express Brno), Brno Ravens Lacrosse Club (lacrosse), Brno Alligators (American football), two
rugby
teams (RC Dragon Brno, RC Bystrc) and others.
Tennis
players
Barbora Krejčíková, Lucie Šafářová, Lukáš Rosol, and
Jana Novotná
are from Brno, as well as
Michal Březina, one of the top Czech figure skaters.
Motorcycle speedway
events were held at the Winter Stadium, off Na Rybníčku in Králové Pole.
The venue hosted a final round of the
Czechoslovak Individual Speedway Championship
in 1949, 1950 and 1954.
Transport
Public transport in Brno consists of 12
tram
lines, 14
trolleybus
lines (the largest trolleybus network in the Czech Republic) and almost 40 day and 11 night bus lines.
Trams (known locally as
šaliny) first appeared on the streets in 1869; this was the first operation of
horse-drawn trams
in the modern-day Czech Republic.
The local public transport system is interconnected with regional public transport in one integrated system (IDS JMK), and directly connects several nearby municipalities with the city.
Its main operator is the Brno City Transport Company (DPmB), which also operates a mostly recreational ferry route at the
Brno Dam Lake.
A tourist
minibus
provides a brief tour of the city.
In 2011, the city announced plans to build a
metro system
light rail system to alleviate overcrowding of trams and to reduce congestion on the surface.",static
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brno,"Brno

Railway transport began operating in the city in 1839 on the Brno–Vienna line, the first operating railway line in the modern-day Czech Republic.
Today, Brno is a transnational railway hub, with nine stations for passenger traffic. The current
main railway station
is the central hub of regional train services, used by about 50,000 passengers every day, with around 500 trains passing through. The station is currently operating at full capacity;
the main station building is outdated and lacks sufficient operating capacity, but the construction of the new station has been postponed several times for various reasons.
A
referendum
over whether to move the station was held on 7 and 8 October 2016, coinciding with
regional elections.
Brno is also an international road transport crossroads. There are two
motorways
on the southern edge of the city: the D1 leading to
Ostrava
and
Prague, and the D2 leading to
Bratislava.
Not far from the city limits is the
D52 motorway
leading to
Vienna. Another planned motorway, the
D43, will connect Brno to northwestern Moravia.
The city is gradually building the large city
ring road (road I/42). Several road tunnels have been built at Pisarky, Husovice, Hlinky, and Královo pole, and more are planned.
Due to the congestion in private transport, the city is continuing to try to build more
parking ramps, including underground, but these efforts have not always been successful.
Air transport is enabled by two functional airports. The public international airport, Brno–Tuřany Airport, saw a sharp increase in passenger traffic up to 2011, however the number of passengers declined in the following years, especially during the
COVID-19 pandemic. The airport also serves as one of the two bases for police helicopters in the Czech Republic. The other airport, Medlánky Airport, is a small domestic airport serving mainly recreational activities such as flying
hot air balloons, gliders
or aircraft
RC models.
Cycling is widespread in Brno due to lowland nature of the landscape. Existing tracks for cycling and roller skating in 2011 totalled approximately 38 kilometres (24 mi), and are gradually being expanded.
There is also one long
bikeway
leading to
Vienna, approximately 130 kilometres (81 mi) long.
Several hiking trails of the Czech Tourist Club also pass through Brno.

How do I apply for the visa?
Once you were hired by your employer, you have signed the employment contract , and your employer told you the vacancy number for your application form, you could apply for an Employee card.
The Employee card is a single permit to stay in the Czech Republic for the purpose of employment and to perform work in the job, for which the card was issued. The Employee card is for all types of employment regardless of the level of required professional qualification.
You must file the written application in person at your local
Embassy of the Czech Republic.
If you are already staying in the territory of the Czech Republic on a visa for a stay over 90 days or on a long term residence permit for some other purpose, you can file the application with the Czech Immigration office (MOI).
The folder for the application will need to contain i.e. the employment contract, proof of accommodation in Brno, professional qualification or diploma, criminal record, a photograph. For the complete list and requirements contact your local
Embassy of the Czech Republic
or visit the
Immigration office website.
When your application is approved, the embassy will issue a visa for the purpose of collecting your employee card (D/VR). Before the visa is issued, you will be asked to submit a travel health insurance valid for the period from the date of entry into the CR to the date on which you are to start working. You will automatically join the public health insurance system on the day you start working.
After the arrival to the CR, you have to visit the
Immigration Office (MOI) within 3 working days and pick up your employee card.
Can you help me with the visa application?
We can provide a general overview and explain how to apply for an Employee card. You can find out more about the process in the guide

General info
To be insured for medical expenses is not only a legal obligation in the Czech Republic, but also a life necessity. Each foreigner who wants to stay here for more than 3 months must be medically insured in the CR. There are two types of health insurance – public and commercial.
As the
public health insurance
is a public service not intended for the profit of the Czech government, it is of a much better value for your pocket, as well as security for your health. There are basically no limits for the coverage of the medical expenses and the insurance company cannot cancel your insurance or refuse to extend it if you fulfill required conditions.
This is different with the
commercial health insurance. This insurance is not under such strict public control and gives insurance companies more room to benefit from the people insured. The monthly premium could be less than with the public insurance, but the coverage has lower limits at the same time. The doctors have more difficulties keeping the cost of medical services under the limits, and there is more paperwork for docs too. The biggest risk with the commercial health insurance is that the company can ditch the policy holder when he/she becomes too expensive and not extend the insurance when requested.
You cannot decide which insurance system you belong to. This is strictly determined by your nationality or personal/economical situation. You cannot switch between the systems as you wish. Use the filters above to find answers for your questions based on your personal situation.

What's your situation? Choose from below to get the right information.
Are you an EU or non-EU citizen?
eu
Which insurance system do I belong to?
You belong to the public health insurance system. All foreigners with an EU passport, whether economically active – employed or freelancing – or not, belong to the public health insurance system.
All non-EU foreigners who are
employed with a Czech employer, have a permanent residence card, are family members of an EU citizen, or have Temporary protection for Ukrainian refugees
belong to the public health insurance system.
How do I enter the health insurance system?
Automatically. It is an obligation of your employer to register you in the insurance system. To one of the public health insurance companies, to the employer’s preference.
You are legally registered from the first day when you start your job . It may take a month or two to the employer to deliver the insurance card to you, but you can use the insurance anytime before that.
What happens if I quit my job?
Your employer automatically informs the insurance company and stops paying your insurance within 3 days.
If you are unemployed, you can continue with the same insurance company and pay as “a self-payer”; the amount changes every year (in 2021 it is 2,052 CZK a month). Or you may register as a jobseeker with the Labour office and the government will take over the payments until you have a taxable income again.
Learn more about the Labour office in the guide
When unemployed.
Who pays my insurance and how much is it?
The insurance premium is being sent to the insurance company by your employer.
If you have an employment contract or an employment agreement of work activity (“ Dohoda o pracovní činnosti ”) and your monthly income has reached a certain amount (at least 4.000,- CZK), your employer is obliged to pay your insurance premium.
You pay, your employer takes off, 4,5 % of your gross salary, and your employer pays 9 % on top. If you suspect your employer (company, agency) is not paying health insurance premiums properly, you can obtain a receipt of what has been paid from your insurance company.",administration

Can I interrupt or change or opt out of the insurance system?
You cannot switch the public insurance system to commercial insurance or vice versa. If you are resident in the CR (for more than 3 months or as soon as economically active), you have to participate in the public health insurance system.
In case your life or work situation changes (e.g. your job finishes), you need to recontact your public health insurance company to make sure you remain in the public health insurance system in the right category (job seeker, parent looking after a minor child etc.).
You can take a break from the insurance payments in case you decide to move out form the Czech Republic for a longer period of time (3 months or more) with no intention to return any time soon but you need to deregister first.
However, if you are a holder of a permanent residency permit, you can only opt out of the public health insurance system in case you leave the country for over 6 months and inform your health insurance company in writing in advance. You will only be allowed to return back to the system if you can prove that you were medically insured abroad during the whole period of time when you were absent.
Can I travel with my Czech health insurance card?
Your blue insurance card is EHIC – European Health Insurance Card . It is valid for emergency and urgent treatment in all EEA (EU+Norway+Iceland+Liechtenstein) countries and Switzerland.
The intention of the EHIC scheme is to allow people to continue their stay in a country without having to return home for medical care; as such, it does not cover people who have visited a country for the purpose of obtaining medical care, nor does it cover care, such as many types of dental treatment, which can be delayed until the individual returns to his or her home country.
It only covers healthcare which is normally covered by a statutory health care system in the visited country, so it does not render travel insurance obsolete.",administration

What does my insurance card cover?
The public health insurance covers all services that are intended to improve or maintain the health of the insured, or to alleviate his or her suffering. The insurance covers both ambulatory and institutional care, preventive care, the provision of medicines, drugs or medical devices, spa care and others.
This healthcare is provided free of charge to you in a healthcare facility that has a contract with your health insurance provider. However, in the case of acute need for medical treatment, you may not be refused in a medical facility that does not have a contract.
Only the basic material and treatment is paid in the case of dental treatment. Only a small part of healthcare is excluded from the health insurance, for example cosmetic surgery without any health reason.
You always have to have the insurance card for every visit to a doctor or medical facility and, in case you have medicine from doctor’s prescription, for collecting your medicines at a pharmacy.
What insurance companies are there? Can I choose between them?
There are seven public insurance companies. You can choose between them freely.
All provide the same coverage of health care by law; the only difference can be an offer of some benefits, discounts, and allowances. You always pay the same insurance premium (set by law), no matter what company you choose.",administration

Who pays my insurance and how much is it?
If self-employment is your main economic activity, the amount paid in contributions depends on your income, but the minimum is 2,722 CZK/month (2023). In the first year of their trade licence, everyone starts with the minimum health care contribution, regardless of the (expected) annual income.
If you have a job as an employee and are using the trade licence for a secondary income, then you are not required to pay monthly advances. The contribution for the
previous year depends on the total business profit.
When your income tax return is being prepared you or your accountant will also calculate whether the minimum health care contributions were enough or whether you must pay extra. Also, based on the income from the previous year, you will be informed by your accountant of the new monthly health care contribution for the current year.
The amount is determined by the profit achieved in the previous year. The assessment base for calculation of health insurance is 50% of the profit (gross income minus expenses equals profit). The health care contribution is 13.5% of the assessment base. In most cases – where the lump sum for expenses is 60% – this effectively amounts to about 2.7% of the income.
If the actual assessment base is lower than the minimum calculation basis, then the health care contribution is set at the minimum monthly advance mentioned above.
Public health insurance must be paid before the 8th of the current month for each
previous month. The contributions must be sent to the account of the health insurance company you have selected (from a total of six that are officially credited), with your IČO number as the variable code.",administration

The commercial insurance differs from the public health insurance on principle, mainly with the existing indemnification limit, and also the scope of the covered care is limited. There are two basic types of insurance:
health insurance for cases of emergency urgent care and for short stays only, called basic health insurance = základní zdravotní pojištění , health insurance for cases of complex care and for stays over 90 days, called comprehensive health insurance = komplexní zdravotní pojištění

Change of address
Foreigners with a long-term visa or residence card are required to report a change of residence address within 30 days of it occurring if the change in the place of residence is expected to last longer than 30 days.
Foreigners with a permanent residence permit are required to report a change of residence within 30 days of it occurring if the change in the place of residence is expected to last longer than 180 days.
The new place of residence must be reported to the
MOI office
in the area of the new place of residence.
To report this change, in person
or
by post
or

There is no need to exchange a long-term residence permit biometric card for a new address when you move. The residence permit cards issued after Aug 1 2019 to holders of long-term residence permits no longer state the information on the holder’s registered address of residence. On request, the current place of residence in the country can be entered into their travel document, or a written certificate can be issued.
However, a permanent residence permit card containing the address needs to be exchanged and there is a fee (in “kolek” stamps) 1 000 CZK for and adult and 500,- for a child up to 15 years of age.
So, unless one wishes to obtain written confirmation of their current place of residence, instead of visiting the office in person, you can just send 1) the original or the certified copy of your new accommodation contract along with the 2) form for reporting changes as a registered mail in an envelope or use the data mailbox to contact the Immigration office (Tuřanka 115b).

Rodné číslo – Czech ID number
The certificate should automatically come with a Czech ID number “ rodné číslo “. Most of the time, however, it is not issued within the same period (it is a different department of the Ministry of Interior) and arrives another month or two later. Hence another visit to the Immigration Office, or wait the additional two months and pick up the certificate with the ID number already printed. The Immigration office can tell you over the phone (974 801 801) if the number is ready or not.

It is good to know your application number. If you didn’t get the application number at the office in person, you should ask in the application form to send the number to you.

How do I extend my residence certificate?
Extension of your residence certificate is filed at the relevant MOI office on the territory of the Czech Republic (Tuřanka 115b, Brno).

How do I cancel my residency when leaving the CR?
Before leaving Brno and the CR, you and your family members are obliged to hand in the residence card to the Immigration Office.
You can also send the document by registered mail with a letter that you are ending your residence in the Czech Republic. (More about a registered letter in our guide
Postal Services.) Don’t forget to cancel your waste collection fee registration with the municipality too – read more about that responsibility in our guide Waste collection and recycling.

What do I have to do as a British citizen to legalize my stay in the CR?
Right now, you are not obliged to have a residency card issued – until the end of 2020. However, the Czech government recommends doing so in order to prevent administrative difficulties in the future.
The Temporary residence certificate is and easily-obtained residence card, that will allow you to stay here after the transitional period (see the question How can I apply for the temporary residence certificate for EU citizen? above).
Furthermore, the Czech Ministry of Interior recommends applying for a permanent residency card if you’ve stayed in the CR for at least five years.

What type of long-term residence permit can I apply for?
There are three options:
If you have arrived in the CR with a “visa for the purpose of collecting an employee card” issued by a Czech embassy, you have to go to the Immigration office within three business days and pick up your Employee card . Later you can extend the validity of the card or change the purpose of stay to a different residence permit.
If you have arrived in the CR with a short term visa for up to 90 days for the purpose of employment, or you are staying in the CR as a visitor without a visa, and you wish to continue to stay and work in the CR, you have to fill out a new application for the long-term
Employee card
at a Czech embassy abroad (to learn more about this process, read the guide
Visa and Residency
that explains your obligations before arrival). Expect to allow over three months for the proceedings.
If you have been staying in the CR with a long-term residence permit for some other purpose (study, business, family…) and you would like to switch the purpose of stay to employment, you can apply for the Employee card at the Immigration office in Brno. Read the answer to the question “How can I apply for an employee card?” below.
What is a blue card?
Similar to an Employee card, but different. It is a residential status and work permit designed for a long-term stay involving the performance of a highly skilled job .
An EU Blue card entitles a foreign national to stay and work in the CR the same way as the Employee card does. However, foreigners with the Blue card have some advantages – such as switching a job, adding up the periods of stay from all EU countries, having spouses with free access to the labour market from day one etc.
On the other hand, there are some higher requirements for the application – a university degree recognized in the CR, a gross salary higher than 150% of the Czech average (ie. over cca 60.000 CZK a month in 2022), longer processing time. And it is your first employer in the CR who has to agree and open a position available for a Blue card holder.

Immigration office website.

The Made by Fire exhibition commemorates the 150th anniversary of the founding of The Museum of Applied Arts of The Moravian Gallery in Brno. Experience the power and fragility of Bohemian glass and porcelain in their trial by fire.
Glass and porcelain are somewhat of a national treasure. They have a long tradition and a unique place in Czech culture. But what do these terms mean today? Faced with one crisis after another – social, ecological and geopolitical – does it still make sense to develop glass and porcelain into the future?
We believe it does, and we are convinced that the disclaimer “Made in Czechia“ has a bright future ahead, both with standard factories as well as small art studios.
All 50+ original works featured as part of the exhibition have a common origin – their glass, porcelain and ceramics were made in the fires of Czech furnaces and kilns. We selected pieces from prestigious glass producers and exporters, the foremost porcelain works, the major players on the design scene, as well as the up-and-coming generation of designers whose work it pays to follow.
The exhibition will take you through four thematic sections: Industry → , Adaptation → , Identity → and Experiment → .
You will encounter works which test the limits of applied art and deal with contemporary social problems, such as industry competitiveness, its environmental impact, the use of classical forms, and the implementation of new technologies.

Authors of the exhibition concept Ing. M.Sc. Ondřej Rea and Mgr. Petr Lukas will present a unique and normally inaccessible collection connected with the most mysterious objects from almost all continents. All exhibits have one thing in common – the circumstances of their creation or their purpose are surrounded by mysteries and secrets that have not yet been clarified.
Despite the fact that it is a collection of masterful replicas, facsimiles, maquettes and models, it was very difficult to procure them for the exhibition. To secure all the exhibits, we connected with experts not only from several European countries, but also from the USA, India, Australia, Honduras and China.
Probably the most valuable exhibit of the exhibition is a 1:1 replica of the famous Mitchell-Hedges crystal skull. The exhibit is, like the original, precisely cut from a single crystal of natural crystal.

https://www.gotobrno.cz/en/events/falstaff/,"Falstaff
You can’t go wrong with a comedy staged by the director Ondřej Havelka, especially when it’s a comedy by Giuseppe Verdi. Perhaps you wouldn´t expect this genre from a composer of famous tragic operas, but there you would be wrong, as in actual fact Verdi wanted to write a comedy all his life, but only got round to it with his last opera. And so a masterpiece inspired by the famous Shakespearean figure, Sir John Falstaff, was created.
Falstaff, a resident of the Garter Inn, enjoys partaking of good food and drink, but is particularly interested in the local Windsor ladies Alice Ford and Meg Page. The fact that they are both married doesn´t bother him at all; on the contrary, it only adds spice to his desires. Meg and Alice don´t care for his affections, and, with the help of Mistress Quicky, entangle him in their webs and teach him a proper lesson. However, Falstaff concludes this bittersweet comedy with the wise words: “The whole world is a farce.” Verdi, who had experienced a lot himself and knew how to enjoy life, left the world a comic opera that is hard to match. Smart and witty, with occasional subtle parodies of Verdi´s typical heroic performances, full of ensemble numbers which are clearly inspired by Rossini, and with humour overflowing with understanding for all that is human, such is his Falstaff that is returning to the Brno stage after fifty years away.

AUTOTEATRO: TROUBLESOME CLASSMATES
Immersive performance for an audience of two – man and woman
Jana Kaněrová and Zdeněk Adamec. Both born in 1934. Both students during the challenging 1950s in Czechoslovakia. Both classmates of Jana Horáková – the daughter of Milada Horáková, probably the most famous victim of communistic political monster-processes in Czechoslovakia.
Thanks to autoteatro, you might experience for a while what it felt like to be in their skin, and you will be able to imagine what they had to go through.
What is Autoteatro? Autoteatro is a specific form of theater that engages participants in an immersive and interactive experience. In Autoteatro, individuals become both the actors and the audience, blurring the traditional boundaries between performer and spectator. Audience is entering the skin of protagonists of the play, becoming its main characters.
Autoteatro takes place directly in a café during regular opening hours. Participants receive headphones through which they receive all the instructions. The experience is also guided by specially trained actors who enhance the overall atmosphere of the play.
About the play Troublesome Classmates In the play Troublesome Classmates, you will immerse in the lives of two contemporaries of the communist revolution in Czechoslovakia – Jana Kaněrová and Zdeněk Adamec. They experienced the times of World War II, collectivization, and time of fabricated political trials. How do they remember that era? What was it like growing up in a time when one had to be a communist or face repressions that could cost one’s life?
Both Kaněrová and Adamec shared their memories with the Institute of National Memory. Students from JAMU (Janáček Academy of Performing Arts), under the guidance of Monika Okurková, transformed these memories into immersive theater for two spectators.
For each performance, we expect 2 participants, a man and a woman.

kolektiv fau: Rauschen
PLACEK Festival is presenting German theatre colective fau and their performance Rauschen! First time in Brno
The world today is one of a constant background noise: there\’s a podcast on at all times, a discussion, a Tik-Tok video is chasing the next one and it doesn\’t matter how quiet it is – it\’s never actually silent – since our minds won\’t stop reproducing the rhythms around us. In \”Rauschen\” we are searching for the off-switch. We are trying to escape the chaos of everyday life, and instead listen to what silence sounds like, feels like, what it means to break through the static. If this is even possible.
The fau collective are Melanie Klos, Paul Schliermann and Jakob Grundherr. They have been studying theater and media studies at the University of Bayreuth since 2019. Their atmospheric works focus on experiments mapping the intersection of sound, light, video and performance.

“There is always hope. It’s not over until the body is cold!” – Ruth Wolff
Ruth Wolff is the chief physician at an institute for neurological patients. She admits a 14-year-old girl who hasn’t much time to live, trying to give her the most peaceful departure. The next morning, after a tumultuous night, an unexpected visitor shows up at the door of the young patient: the priest from the parish to which the girl’s parents belong. He has come to give her the last sacrament. By refusing an unknown and uninvited priest permission to enter the patient’s room, the physician creates a chaotic situation, resulting in what could be termed a witch hunt. But why didn’t anyone listen to the priest? And was the girl Catholic or not? Was the priest treated in an unjust, aggressive way? And did the doctor do this, perhaps, because she herself is Jewish?
This variation on Schnitzler’s key drama Professor Bernhardi, by the British playwright and screenwriter Robert Icke, returns to the fundamental themes of the early twentieth century themes which are unfortunately still (or perhaps again?) frighteningly topical. It shows that even those who have dedicated their lives to the healing of others might be affected by racial and religious prejudice spread in the public domain without proper justification. And however absurd it is to base one’s decisions about a dying patient on confused public opinion, these things do happen.

Dominated by masterstrokes of vivacious acting, this dynamic commedia dell´arte gives the audience an intense theatrical experience crowned by astonishing numbers sung by both actors and opera singers. An incredibly sophisticated systems of backdrops and drapes enriches the spectators’ visual delight.
The peculiar owner of an inn in Florence, as we know her from Carlo Goldoni’s comedy, is a very competent woman who is more versed in business than anybody else. Both the pub and the rooms are always full and many clients long to win her affection. Some of them let it show rather ostentatiously, such as the impoverished yet boastful Marquis Di Forlipopoli and the upstart, self-centred Earl d’Albafiorit. Even though serving such importunate admirers might seem amusing, the lively innkeeper finds their obtuseness gruelling. Being a jovial person, she sits up and takes notice when baron Di Ripafratta – a sworn adversary of women – walks into her pub. Mirandolina is closely bound to the starring actress Tereza Groszmannová, whose translation of the play is custom-made both for herself and her fellow actors. The characters express themselves with a well-timed vigour, allowing dynamic acting. The highly pertinent and jaunty language of the script plays skilfully with ambiguities.

Did you know why our city is called Brno? Did you know that long ago a fearsome dragon used to terrify the inhabitants of Líšeň? And that a skilful joiner needed a single day to make a wheel and to transport it from the South-Moravian city of Lednice all the way to Brno? Can you imagine all that may happen when, on a rainy afternoon, three pilgrims meet at a local inn and begin to tell their incredible life stories? You can bet that there are some mischievous tales involved!

05/05/2024 17:00 - 19:45
Being happy is possible! But maybe at some other place or at some other time …
After the decease of their father, who provided the whole family with financial support and maintained its thriving social life, the three sisters – Irina, Masha and Olga – are left all by themselves in their small town and their future is far from being bright. The family house, which used to be attended by renowned guests, now attracts merely eccentrics and outsiders. Soon, their brother dissipates the bequest and the necessity of earning their living makes them loose what aristocrats took for granted: free time. Their desire to live a happy and fuller life, their longing for love and for a new home leads the sisters into extreme situations. Bitter laughter, laughable tears – what seems to be ordinary fortunes of common people unlocks great stories of love and adversity. Three Sisters , one of the two plays that Anton Pavlovich Chekhov (1860–1904) wrote specifically for the Moscow Art Theater, is considered to be the Russian playwright’s masterpiece. The four-act drama had a significant impact on European theater, including the Czech one: performed by the Moscow ensemble in Prague in 1906 it revolutionized the local approach to modern acting and directing. In Brno, Three Sisters will be staged by Štěpán Pácl, in-house director of the Dramatic Company of the National Theater Brno, whose successful production of Chekhov’s play The Seagull was adapted into film.

The event takes place as part of Brno Art Week 2024
Florist Přemysl Hytych presents a fashion - floral object - a floral dress inspired by embroidery, which attracted him to traditional clothing in Moravia. The author worked on the basis of personal experience with the collection of the Ethnographic Institute of the MFA. The direct contact with the documents of traditional folk culture, as well as the opportunity to look ""behind the mirror"", i.e. into the depositories of textiles, were subsequently reflected in his work. He was able to translate the floral motifs from costume embroidery into the plane of fashion and the carnation or tulip flowers thus acquired another dimension. This position is underlined by the colours in the basic tones of red - blue - white as a visual echo of the culture of the Moravian countryside. The accentuation of a simple, seemingly notorious detail evokes the message of the past, which the author has translated into the artistic language of today. The exhibited object takes the relationship between tradition and design to a new level of meaning.",event

What is innovative and remarkable is that it is primarily their own self-representation, meaning that members of local ethnic groups have contributed significantly to the preparation of the exhibition. Visitors will thus learn about their rich culture, understanding of nature, mythology, religion, cosmology and interpretation of the world, customs and rituals.",event

ART DESIGN FASHION
Museum of Decorative Arts
Permanent exhibitions

The building of the Museum of Decorative Arts of the Moravian Gallery has received a new concept in 2021: ART DESIGN FASHION. It foreshadows that the museum is dedicated not only to design itself, but also to fashion and the relationship between design and art. Visitors can look forward to a permanent exhibition, exhibitions and new facilities prepared exclusively for the Moravian Gallery by leading Czech designers. The changed appearance of the Museum of Decorative Arts in Brno represents an imaginary showcase of Czech designers and their products. This multi-layered concept is unparalleled in the Czech Republic in terms of scope and quality.

When designing the interior, the gallery was primarily concerned with incorporating the idea of presenting contemporary designers through their designs for interior elements and spaces. The gallery involved Maxim Velčovský, Radek Wohlmuth and the edit! studio, Eva Eisler, David Karásek, the Olgoj Chorchoj studio and Marek Štěpán.

Marie Filippovová represents one of the most prominent figures on the Brno art scene. At first glance, her work impresses with its concentration, sense of rhythm, cyclicality and temporality. To a certain extent, it is also characterised by a certain austerity, or even asceticism. The orderliness with which he completes cycles, sets and volumes of drawings, watercolours and prints, as well as his reliance on lapidary means of expression, is probably related to his deep experience with writing, typography and calligraphy. The generational experience of the artist, who studied free and applied graphics, design and book culture at the Academy of Arts and Crafts in Prague at the turn of the 1950s and 1960s, and then settled permanently in Brno, where she began her independent creative career, is also undeniable.",event
