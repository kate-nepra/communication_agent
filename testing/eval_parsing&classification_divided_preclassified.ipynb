      "Response: header='Historical Overview of Brno, Czech Republic' text=\"Brno, located in the Czech Republic, has a rich history dating back to the 17th century. During the Thirty Years' War, the Holy Roman Emperor and Margrave of Moravia, Ferdinand III, ordered the permanent relocation of the diet, court, and the land tables from Olomouc to Brno due to Olomouc's Collegium Nordicum being a primary target of Swedish armies. In 1642, Olomouc surrendered to the Swedish Army, making Brno the only Moravian city that successfully defended itself from the Swedes under General Lennart Torstenson. As a result, Brno served as the sole capital of the Margraviate of Moravia and retained its status even after the Thirty Years' War in 1648, which was later confirmed by the Holy Roman Emperor Joseph II in 1782 and again in 1849 by the Moravian constitution. Today, the Moravian Land Tables are stored in the Moravian Regional Archive and are included among the national cultural sights of the Czech Republic.\\nŠpilberk Castle was rebuilt as a huge baroque citadel in the 17th century. Brno was besieged by the Prussian Army in 1742 under the leadership of Frederick the Great, but the siege was ultimately unsuccessful. In 1777, the bishopric of Brno was established by the Catholic Church; Mathias Franz Graf von Chorinsky Freiherr von Ledske was the first Bishop.\\nIn December 1805, the Battle of Austerlitz was fought near the city, known as the 'Battle of the Three Emperors'. Napoleon Bonaparte spent several nights in Brno at that time and again in 1809. In 1839, the first train arrived in Brno from Vienna, marking the beginning of rail transport in what is now the Czech Republic. In the years 1859-1864, the city fortifications were almost completely removed, and in 1869, a horsecar service started to operate in Brno, the first tram service in what would later become the Czech Republic.\\nGregor Mendel conducted his groundbreaking experiments in genetics while he was a monk at St. Thomas's Abbey in Brno in the 1850s.\" brief=\"Brno, located in the Czech Republic, has a rich history dating back to the 17th century when it became the sole capital of the Margraviate of Moravia during the Thirty Years' War.

      "Response: header='Legends and Twin Cities of Brno' text=\"There are several legends connected with the City of Brno. One of the best known is the Legend of the Brno Dragon. According to this legend, a terrible creature was terrorizing the citizens of Brno. The people had never seen this animal before, so they called it a dragon. They lived in fear of the dragon until one citizen managed to kill the monster by tricking it into eating a carcass filled with lime. In reality the dragon was a crocodile, the preserved body of which is now displayed at the entrance of the Old Town Hall. Crocodile and dragon motifs are common in Brno. A crocodile (Czech: krokodýl) is the local stuffed baguette, and the city radio station is known as Radio Krokodýl. The local baseball team is named Draci Brno (English: Brno Dragons) and the local rugby club is named RC Dragon Brno. There is also a local American football team called the Brno Alligators. An Intercity train connecting Brno and Prague is called Brněnský drak (English: The Brno dragon). Next to the 'dragon' at the Old Town Hall is the town's second well-known emblem, a wagon wheel made from a tree found and cut down 50 miles from the city. According to the legend, a local man made a wager that he could fell the tree, make a wheel out of it, and roll the wheel to the City of Brno, all within a single day. Since the achievement was deemed to be impossible by normal human means, the man was believed to have called on the devil for assistance, and died in poverty as a result. Another local legend relates to the siege of the city by Swedish forces in 1645. The locals and the Swedish army were in a stalemate, and the Swedish general declared that he would withdraw if his army had not won by noon. The bell ringer at Petrov Cathedral tricked him by ringing the bell an hour early, and keeping his word, the general and his army left. As a historic tribute to the event, the bell at Petrov Cathedral still rings for noon an hour earlier, at 11 o'clock. At this time, the Brno astronomical clock also releases a glass ball as a souvenir.\\nBrno is twinned with: Bratislava, Slovakia; Dallas, United States; Debrecen, Hungary; Kaunas, Lithuania; Kharkiv, Ukraine; Leeds, England, United Kingdom; Leipzig, Germany; Poznań, Poland; Rennes, France; Sankt Pölten, Austria; Stuttgart, Germany.

Moravia was divided into three separate territories with each having its own ruler from the Přemyslids dynasty, but independent of the other two, and subordinate only to the Bohemian ruler in Prague. Brno, Olomouc, and Znojmo were the seats of these rulers and the 'capitals' of these territories.\\n\\nIn the late 12th century, Moravia began to reunify and formed the Margraviate of Moravia. Until the mid-17th century, it was not clear which town should be the capital of Moravia.

Although until 1642 Olomouc had a larger population than Brno, it was the seat of the only Roman Catholic diocese in Moravia.\\n\\nIn 1243 Brno was granted large and small city privileges by the King and recognized as a royal city.

Life in the city was therefore bilingual, and what was called 'Brünnerisch' was a mixed idiom containing elements from both languages. In 1919, after World War I, two neighboring towns, Královo Pole and Husovice, and 21 other municipalities were annexed to Brno, creating Greater Brno. This expansion aimed to dilute the German-speaking majority of close to 55,000 by adding Czech communities from the city's neighborhoods. The German-speaking group also included almost all of the 12,000 Jewish inhabitants, who contributed significantly to the city's cultural life. Greater Brno was almost seven times larger with a population of about 222,000 – before that Brno had about 130,000 inhabitants. In 1921, Brno became the capital of the Land of Moravia and then the Land of Moravia-Silesia in 1928. In 1930, 200,000 inhabitants declared themselves to be of Czech nationality, and some 52,000 were of German nationality, including the respective Jewish citizens. During the German occupation of the Czech lands between 1939 and 1945, all Czech universities were closed by the Nazis, with the Faculty of Law becoming the headquarters of the Gestapo, and the university hall of residence was used as a prison for about 35,000 Czechs and some American and British prisoners of war.

After Terezín, many of them were sent to Auschwitz concentration camp, Minsk Ghetto, Rejowiec and other ghettos and concentration camps. Although Terezín was not an extermination camp, 995 people transported from Brno died there. Only 1,033 people returned after the war. Industrial facilities such as the Československá zbrojovka arms factory and the Zweigwerk aircraft engine factory (which became Zbrojovka's subsidiary Zetor after the war) and the city centre were targeted by several Allied bombardment campaigns between 1944 and 1945. The air strikes and later artillery fire killed some 1,200 people and destroyed 1,278 buildings. After the city's occupation by the Red Army on 26 April 1945 and the end of the war, ethnic German residents were expelled. In the Brno death march, beginning on 31 May 1945, about 27,000 German inhabitants of Brno were marched 64 kilometres (40 miles) to the Austrian border.

The Mahen Theatre was the first theatre building in Europe to be illuminated by Thomas Edison's electric light bulbs; at that time it was a completely new invention and there were no power plants built in the city, so a small steam power plant was built nearby just to power the theatre, and Edison came to Brno in 1911 to see it. The most commercially successful theatre in Brno is the Brno City Theatre, founded in 1945; its performances are usually sold out. They also stage about 150 performances abroad every year. The theatre's repertoire consists primarily of musical and dramatic shows. There are a variety of smaller theatres in Brno, including the Bolek Polivka Theatre, the Goose on a String Theatre ('Divadlo Husa na provázku'), HaDivadlo, Radost Puppet Theatre ('loutkové divadlo Radost'), and Polárka Theatre. The Mahen Theatre was originally called the City Theatre, and until 1918 it performed exclusively in German and was not part of the National Theatre of Brno. Between 1971 and 1978, some plays were performed at the Brno Exhibition Centre due to reconstruction of the Mahen Theatre.\" brief='Brno has a rich theatre history, starting from the 1660s. The city is home to several notable theatres including Reduta Theatre, National Theatre of Brno, and Brno City Theatre. The Mahen Theatre was the first in Europe to use electric light bulbs. Smaller theatres like Bolek Polivka Theatre and Goose on a String Theatre are also popular.' address='Brno, Czech Republic'\n"

The station is currently operating at full capacity; the main station building is outdated and lacks sufficient operating capacity, but the construction of the new station has been postponed several times for various reasons.\\nBrno is also an international road transport crossroads. There are two motorways on the southern edge of the city: the D1 leading to Ostrava and Prague, and the D2 leading to Bratislava. Not far from the city limits is the D52 motorway leading to Vienna. Another planned motorway, the D43, will connect Brno to northwestern Moravia. The city is gradually building the large city ring road (road I/42). Several road tunnels have been built at Pisarky, Husovice, Hlinky, and Královo pole, and more are planned.\\nDue to the congestion in private transport, the city is continuing to try to build more parking ramps, including underground, but these efforts have not always been successful.\\nAir transport is enabled by two functional airports.

In the first year of their trade license, everyone starts with the minimum health care contribution, regardless of the (expected) annual income. If you have a job as an employee and are using the trade license for a secondary income, then you are not required to pay monthly advances. The contribution for the previous year depends on the total business profit. When your income tax return is being prepared, you or your accountant will also calculate whether the minimum health care contributions were enough or whether you must pay extra. Also based on the income from the previous year, you will be informed of the new monthly health care contribution for the current year. The amount is determined by the profit achieved in the previous year. The assessment base for calculation of health insurance is 50% of the profit (gross income minus expenses equals profit). The health care contribution is 13.5% of the assessment base. In most cases – where the lump sum for expenses is 60% – this effectively amounts to about 2.7% of the income. If the actual assessment base is lower than the minimum calculation basis, then the health care contribution is set at the minimum monthly advance mentioned above.

The author worked on the basis of personal experience with the collection of the Ethnographic Institute of the MFA. The direct contact with the documents of traditional folk culture, as well as the opportunity to look 'behind the mirror', i.e. into the depositories of textiles, were subsequently reflected in his work. He was able to translate the floral motifs from costume embroidery into the plane of fashion and the carnation or tulip flowers thus acquired another dimension. This position is underlined by the colours in the basic tones of red - blue - white as a visual echo of the culture of the Moravian countryside.

In 1642 Olomouc surrendered to the Swedish Army, which occupied it for eight years. Meanwhile, Brno succeeded in defending itself from the Swedes under General Lennart Torstenson, served as the sole capital of the Margraviate of Moravia. After the end of the Thirty Years' War in 1648, Brno retained its status as the sole capital. This was later confirmed by the Holy Roman Emperor Joseph II in 1782, and again in 1849 by the Moravian constitution. Today, the Moravian Land Tables are stored in the Moravian Regional Archive, and are included among the national cultural sights of the Czech Republic. During the 17th century Špilberk Castle was rebuilt as a huge baroque citadel. Brno was besieged by the Prussian Army in 1742 under the leadership of Frederick the Great, but the siege was ultimately unsuccessful. In 1777 the bishopric of Brno was established by the Catholic Church; Mathias Franz Graf von Chorinsky Freiherr von Ledske was the first Bishop. In December 1805 the Battle of Austerlitz was fought near the city; the battle is also known as the 'Battle of the Three Emperors'. Brno itself was not involved with the battle, but the French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte spent several nights here at that time, and again in 1809. In 1839 the first train arrived in Brno from Vienna; this was the beginning of rail transport in what is now the Czech Republic. In the years 1859–1864 the city fortifications were almost completely removed. In 1869 a horse-car service started to operate in Brno, the first tram service in what would later become the Czech Republic. Gregor Mendel conducted his groundbreaking experiments in genetics while he was a monk at St. Thomas's Abbey in Brno in the 1850s.\" brief=\"Brno has a rich history dating back to the 17th century, serving as the sole capital of the Margraviate of Moravia during the Thirty Years' War.

According to this legend, a terrible creature was terrorizing the citizens of Brno. The people had never seen this animal before, so they called it a dragon. They lived in fear of the dragon until one citizen managed to kill the monster by tricking it into eating a carcass filled with lime. In reality the dragon was a crocodile, the preserved body of which is now displayed at the entrance of the Old Town Hall. Crocodile and dragon motifs are common in Brno. A crocodile (Czech: krokodýl) is the local stuffed baguette, and the city radio station is known as Radio Krokodýl. The local baseball team is named Draci Brno (English: Brno Dragons) and the local rugby club is named RC Dragon Brno. There is also a local American football team called the Brno Alligators. An Intercity train connecting Brno and Prague is called Brněnský drak (English: The Brno dragon). Next to the \"dragon\" at the Old Town Hall is the town\\'s second well-known emblem, a wagon wheel made from a tree found and cut down 50 miles from the city. According to the legend, a local man made a wager that he could fell the tree, make a wheel out of it, and roll the wheel to the City of Brno, all within a single day. Since the achievement was deemed to be impossible by normal human means, the man was believed to have called on the devil for assistance, and died in poverty as a result. Another local legend relates to the siege of the city by Swedish forces in 1645. The locals and the Swedish army were in a stalemate, and the Swedish general declared that he would withdraw if his army had not won by noon. The bell ringer at Petrov Cathedral tricked him by ringing the bell an hour early, and keeping his word, the general and his army left. As a historic tribute to the event, the bell at Petrov Cathedral still rings for noon an hour earlier, at 11 o\\'clock. At this time, the Brno astronomical clock also releases a glass ball as a souvenir.

      "Response: header='Brno' text='In the early 11th century Brno was established as a castle of a non-ruling prince from the House of Přemyslid, and Brno became one of the centres of Moravia along with Olomouc and Znojmo. Brno was first mentioned in Cosmas\\' Chronica Boemorum dated to the year 1091, when Bohemian king Vratislaus II besieged his brother Conrad at Brno castle. In the mid 11th century, Moravia was divided into three separate territories; each had its own ruler, coming from the Přemyslids dynasty, but independent of the other two, and subordinate only to the Bohemian ruler in Prague. The seats of these rulers and thus the \"capitals\" of these territories were the castles and towns of Brno, Olomouc, and Znojmo. In the late 12th century, Moravia began to reunify, forming the Margraviate of Moravia. From then until the mid of the 17th century, it was not clear which town should be the capital of Moravia. Political power was divided between Brno and Olomouc, but Znojmo also played an important role. The Moravian Diet, the Moravian Land Tables, and the Moravian Land Court were all seated in both cities at once. However, Brno was the official seat of the Moravian Margraves (rulers of Moravia), and later its geographical position closer to Vienna also became important. Otherwise, until 1642 Olomouc had a larger population than Brno, and was the seat of the only Roman Catholic diocese in Moravia. In 1243 Brno was granted the large and small city privileges by the King, and was thus recognized as a royal city. As throughout Eastern Central Europe, the granting of city privileges was connected with immigration from German-speaking lands. In 1324 Queen Elisabeth Richeza of Poland founded the Basilica of the Assumption of Our Lady, which now houses her grave. In the 14th century, Brno became one of the centres for the Moravian regional assemblies, whose meetings alternated between Brno and Olomouc. These assemblies made political, legal, and financial decisions. Brno and Olomouc were also the seats of the Land Court and the Moravian Land Tables, thus they were the two most important cities in Moravia. From the mid 14th century to the early 15th century, Špilberk Castle had served as the permanent seat of the Margraves of Moravia; one of them was elected the King of the Romans. Brno was besieged in 1428 and again in 1430 by the Hussites during the Hussite Wars. Both attempts to conquer the city failed.' brief=\"Brno was established as a castle in the early 11th century and became one of the centres of Moravia.

Life in the city was therefore bilingual, and what was called in German 'Brünnerisch' was a mixed idiom containing elements from both languages. In 1919, after World War I, two neighbouring towns, Královo Pole and Husovice, and 21 other municipalities were annexed to Brno, creating Greater Brno (Czech: Velké Brno). This was done to dilute the German-speaking majority of close to 55,000 by the addition of the Czech communities of the city's neighborhood. Included in the German-speaking group were almost all of the 12,000 Jewish inhabitants, including several of the city's better known personalities, who made a substantial contribution to the city's cultural life. Greater Brno was almost seven times larger, with a population of about 222,000 – before that Brno had about 130,000 inhabitants. In 1921 Brno became the capital of the Land of Moravia (Czech: země Moravská ). Seven years later, Brno became the capital of the Land of Moravia-Silesia (Czech: země Moravskoslezská ). In 1930, 200,000 inhabitants declared themselves to be of Czech, and some 52,000 of German nationality, in both cases including the respective Jewish citizens. During the German occupation of the Czech lands between 1939 and 1945, all Czech universities were closed by the Nazis, including those in Brno. The Faculty of Law became the headquarters of the Gestapo, and the university hall of residence was used as a prison. About 35,000 Czechs and some American and British prisoners of war were imprisoned and tortured there; about 800 civilians were executed or died. Executions were public. The Nazis also operated a subcamp of the Auschwitz concentration camp, which held mostly Polish prisoners, an internment camp for Romani people in the city, and a forced labour 'education' camp in the present-day district of Dvorska.\" brief=\"Brno's history includes its bilingual German-Czech population, becoming Greater Brno after World War I, and later the capital of Moravia.

After Terezín, many of them were sent to Auschwitz concentration camp, Minsk Ghetto, Rejowiec and other ghettos and concentration camps. Although Terezín was not an extermination camp, 995 people transported from Brno died there. Only 1,033 people returned after the war. Industrial facilities such as the Československá zbrojovka arms factory and the Zweigwerk aircraft engine factory (which became Zbrojovka's subsidiary Zetor after the war) and the city centre were targeted by several Allied bombardment campaigns between 1944 and 1945. The air strikes and later artillery fire killed some 1,200 people and destroyed 1,278 buildings. After the city's occupation by the Red Army on 26 April 1945 and the end of the war, ethnic German residents were expelled. In the Brno death march, beginning on 31 May 1945, about 27,000 German inhabitants of Brno were marched 64 kilometres (40 miles) to the Austrian border. According to testimony collected by German sources, about 5,200 of them died during the march. Later estimates by Czech sources put the death toll at about 1,700, with most deaths due to an epidemic of shigellosis. After the reestablishment of an independent Czechoslovak state after World War II, Prime Minister Edvard Beneš delivered a speech in Brno demanding the expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia. Shortly afterwards, 20,000 ethnic Germans from the city were expelled into Allied-occupied Austria. After the 1948 Czechoslovak coup d'état, the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic abolished Moravian autonomy and Brno thus ceased to be the capital of Moravia. Since then Moravia has been divided into administrative regions, with Brno the administrative centre of the South Moravian Region. In 1960s and 1970s, large panel housing estates were built in border districts, such as Bohunice, Líšeň, Bystrc and Vinohrady.

Public transport in Brno consists of 12 tram lines, 14 trolleybus lines (the largest trolleybus network in the Czech Republic) and almost 40 day and 11 night bus lines. Trams (known locally as šaliny) first appeared on the streets in 1869; this was the first operation of horse-drawn trams in the modern-day Czech Republic. The local public transport system is interconnected with regional public transport in one integrated system (IDS JMK), and directly connects several nearby municipalities with the city.

      "Response: header='Brno City Information' text='Railway transport began operating in the city in 1839 on the Brno–Vienna line, the first operating railway line in the modern-day Czech Republic. Today, Brno is a transnational railway hub, with nine stations for passenger traffic. The current main railway station is the central hub of regional train services, used by about 50,000 passengers every day, with around 500 trains passing through. The station is currently operating at full capacity; the main station building is outdated and lacks sufficient operating capacity, but the construction of the new station has been postponed several times for various reasons. A referendum over whether to move the station was held on 7 and 8 October 2016, coinciding with regional elections. Brno is also an international road transport crossroads. There are two motorways on the southern edge of the city: the D1 leading to Ostrava and Prague, and the D2 leading to Bratislava. Not far from the city limits is the D52 motorway leading to Vienna. Another planned motorway, the D43, will connect Brno to northwestern Moravia. The city is gradually building the large city ring road (road I/42). Several road tunnels have been built at Pisarky, Husovice, Hlinky, and Královo pole, and more are planned. Due to the congestion in private transport, the city is continuing to try to build more parking ramps, including underground, but these efforts have not always been successful. Air transport is enabled by two functional airports. The public international airport, Brno–Tuřany Airport, saw a sharp increase in passenger traffic up to 2011, however the number of passengers declined in the following years, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. The airport also serves as one of the two bases for police helicopters in the Czech Republic. The other airport, Medlánky Airport, is a small domestic airport serving mainly recreational activities such as flying hot air balloons, gliders or aircraft RC models. Cycling is widespread in Brno due to lowland nature of the landscape. Existing tracks for cycling and roller skating in 2011 totalled approximately 38 kilometres (24 mi), and are gradually being expanded. There is also one long bikeway leading to Vienna, approximately 130 kilometres (81 mi) long. Several hiking trails of the Czech Tourist Club also pass through Brno.' brief='Brno is a city with a rich transportation network, including railway hubs, motorways, airports, and cycling tracks.

Perhaps you wouldn´t expect this genre from a composer of famous tragic operas, but there you would be wrong, as in actual fact Verdi wanted to write a comedy all his life, but only got round to it with his last opera. And so a masterpiece inspired by the famous Shakespearean figure, Sir John Falstaff, was created.\\nFalstaff, a resident of the Garter Inn, enjoys partaking of good food and drink, but is particularly interested in the local Windsor ladies Alice Ford and Meg Page. The fact that they are both married doesn´t bother him at all; on the contrary, it only adds spice to his desires. Meg and Alice don´t care for his affections, and, with the help of Mistress Quicky, entangle him in their webs and teach him a proper lesson.\\nHowever, Falstaff concludes this bittersweet comedy with the wise words: “The whole world is a farce.” Verdi, who had experienced a lot himself and knew how to enjoy life, left the world a comic opera that is hard to match. Smart and witty, with occasional subtle parodies of Verdi´s typical heroic performances, full of ensemble numbers which are clearly inspired by Rossini, and with humour overflowing with understanding for all that is human, such is his Falstaff that is returning to the Brno stage after fifty years away.' brief='A comedy opera by Giuseppe Verdi, inspired by Shakespearean figure Sir John Falstaff, about a man who enjoys good food and drink and is interested in local Windsor ladies.

      "Response: header='Robert Icke: Lady Doctor' text='“There is always hope. It’s not over until the body is cold!” – Ruth Wolff\\nRuth Wolff is the chief physician at an institute for neurological patients. She admits a 14-year-old girl who hasn’t much time to live, trying to give her the most peaceful departure. The next morning, after a tumultuous night, an unexpected visitor shows up at the door of the young patient: the priest from the parish to which the girl’s parents belong. He has come to give her the last sacrament. By refusing an unknown and uninvited priest permission to enter the patient’s room, the physician creates a chaotic situation, resulting in what could be termed a witch hunt. But why didn’t anyone listen to the priest? And was the girl Catholic or not? Was the priest treated in an unjust, aggressive way? And did the doctor do this, perhaps, because she herself is Jewish?\\nThis variation on Schnitzler’s key drama Professor Bernhardi, by the British playwright and screenwriter Robert Icke, returns to the fundamental themes of the early twentieth century themes which are unfortunately still (or perhaps again?) frighteningly topical. It shows that even those who have dedicated their lives to the healing of others might be affected by racial and religious prejudice spread in the public domain without proper justification. And however absurd it is to base one’s decisions about a dying patient on confused public opinion, these things do happen.”' brief=\"Lady Doctor, a drama play by Robert Icke, explores themes of racial and religious prejudice in the medical field through the story of a chief physician and a young patient.

The family house, which used to be attended by renowned guests, now attracts merely eccentrics and outsiders. Soon, their brother dissipates the bequest and the necessity of earning their living makes them loose what aristocrats took for granted: free time. Their desire to live a happy and fuller life, their longing for love and for a new home leads the sisters into extreme situations. Bitter laughter, laughable tears – what seems to be ordinary fortunes of common people unlocks great stories of love and adversity. Three Sisters , one of the two plays that Anton Pavlovich Chekhov (1860–1904) wrote specifically for the Moscow Art Theater, is considered to be the Russian playwright’s masterpiece. The four-act drama had a significant impact on European theater, including the Czech one: performed by the Moscow ensemble in Prague in 1906 it revolutionized the local approach to modern acting and directing. In Brno, Three Sisters will be staged by Štěpán Pácl, in-house director of the Dramatic Company of the National Theater Brno, whose successful production of Chekhov’s play The Seagull was adapted into film.\\n' brief=\"The three sisters – Irina, Masha and Olga – are left alone after their father's death, struggling to maintain their social life and longing for a happy and fuller life.

Life in the city was therefore bilingual, and what was called in German 'Brünnerisch' was a mixed idiom containing elements from both languages. In 1919, after World War I, two neighbouring towns, Královo Pole and Husovice, and 21 other municipalities were annexed to Brno, creating Greater Brno (Czech: Velké Brno). This was done to dilute the German-speaking majority of close to 55,000 by the addition of the Czech communities of the city's neighborhood. Included in the German-speaking group were almost all of the 12,000 Jewish inhabitants, including several of the city's better known personalities, who made a substantial contribution to the city's cultural life. Greater Brno was almost seven times larger, with a population of about 222,000 – before that Brno had about 130,000 inhabitants. In 1921 Brno became the capital of the Land of Moravia (Czech: země Moravská ). Seven years later, Brno became the capital of the Land of Moravia-Silesia (Czech: země Moravskoslezská ). In 1930, 200,000 inhabitants declared themselves to be of Czech, and some 52,000 of German nationality, in both cases including the respective Jewish citizens. During the German occupation of the Czech lands between 1939 and 1945, all Czech universities were closed by the Nazis, including those in Brno. The Faculty of Law became the headquarters of the Gestapo, and the university hall of residence was used as a prison. About 35,000 Czechs and some American and British prisoners of war were imprisoned and tortured there; about 800 civilians were executed or died. Executions were public.

Its main operator is the Brno City Transport Company (DPmB), which also operates a mostly recreational ferry route at the Brno Dam Lake. A tourist minibus provides a brief tour of the city.

      "Response: header='Health Insurance' text=\"To be insured for medical expenses is not only a legal obligation in the Czech Republic, but also a life necessity. Each foreigner who wants to stay here for more than 3 months must be medically insured in the CR. There are two types of health insurance – public and commercial. As the public health insurance is a public service not intended for the profit of the Czech government, it is of a much better value for your pocket, as well as security for your health. There are basically no limits for the coverage of the medical expenses and the insurance company cannot cancel your insurance or refuse to extend it if you fulfill required conditions. This is different with the commercial health insurance. This insurance is not under such strict public control and gives insurance companies more room to benefit from the people insured. The monthly premium could be less than with the public insurance, but the coverage has lower limits at the same time. The doctors have more difficulties keeping the cost of medical services under the limits, and there is more paperwork for docs too. The biggest risk with the commercial health insurance is that the company can ditch the policy holder when he/she becomes too expensive and not extend the insurance when requested. You cannot decide which insurance system you belong to. This is strictly determined by your nationality or personal/economical situation. You cannot switch between the systems as you wish.

Your blue insurance card is EHIC – European Health Insurance Card . It is valid for emergency and urgent treatment in all EEA (EU+Norway+Iceland+Liechtenstein) countries and Switzerland. The intention of the EHIC scheme is to allow people to continue their stay in a country without having to return home for medical care; as such, it does not cover people who have visited a country for the purpose of obtaining medical care, nor does it cover care, such as many types of dental treatment, which can be delayed until the individual returns to his or her home country.

Perhaps you wouldn´t expect this genre from a composer of famous tragic operas, but there you would be wrong, as in actual fact Verdi wanted to write a comedy all his life, but only got round to it with his last opera. And so a masterpiece inspired by the famous Shakespearean figure, Sir John Falstaff, was created.\\r\\n\\r\\nFalstaff, a resident of the Garter Inn, enjoys partaking of good food and drink, but is particularly interested in the local Windsor ladies Alice Ford and Meg Page. The fact that they are both married doesn´t bother him at all; on the contrary, it only adds spice to his desires. Meg and Alice don´t care for his affections, and, with the help of Mistress Quicky, entangle him in their webs and teach him a proper lesson. However, Falstaff concludes this bittersweet comedy with the wise words: “The whole world is a farce.” Verdi, who had experienced a lot himself and knew how to enjoy life, left the world a comic opera that is hard to match.\\r\\n\\r\\nSmart and witty, with occasional subtle parodies of Verdi´s typical heroic performances, full of ensemble numbers which are clearly inspired by Rossini, and with humour overflowing with understanding for all that is human, such is his Falstaff that is returning to the Brno stage after fifty years away.' brief=\"A comic opera inspired by Shakespearean figure Sir John Falstaff.

At first glance, her work impresses with its concentration, sense of rhythm, cyclicality and temporality. To a certain extent, it is also characterised by a certain austerity, or even asceticism. The orderliness with which he completes cycles, sets and volumes of drawings, watercolours and prints, as well as his reliance on lapidary means of expression, is probably related to his deep experience with writing, typography and calligraphy.\\nThe generational experience of the artist, who studied free and applied graphics, design and book culture at the Academy of Arts and Crafts in Prague at the turn of the 1950s and 1960s, and then settled permanently in Brno, where she began her independent creative career, is also undeniable.' brief='Artwork characteristics: concentration, sense of rhythm, cyclicality and temporality; a certain austerity or asceticism.' address='Pražák Palace' dates='[{\"start\": \"2024-04-19\"}]'\n"

After Terezín, many of them were sent to Auschwitz concentration camp, Minsk Ghetto, Rejowiec, and other ghettos and concentration camps. Although Terezín was not an extermination camp, 995 people transported from Brno died there. Only 1,033 people returned after the war. Industrial facilities such as the Československá zbrojovka arms factory and the Zweigwerk aircraft engine factory (which became Zbrojovka\\'s subsidiary Zetor after the war) and the city centre were targeted by several Allied bombardment campaigns between 1944 and 1945. The air strikes and later artillery fire killed some 1,200 people and destroyed 1,278 buildings. After the city\\'s occupation by the Red Army on 26 April 1945 and the end of the war, ethnic German residents were expelled. In the Brno death march, beginning on 31 May 1945, about 27,000 German inhabitants of Brno were marched 64 kilometres (40 miles) to the Austrian border. According to testimony collected by German sources, about 5,200 of them died during the march. Later estimates by Czech sources put the death toll at about 1,700, with most deaths due to an epidemic of shigellosis. After the reestablishment of an independent Czechoslovak state after World War II, Prime Minister Edvard Beneš delivered a speech in Brno demanding the expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia. Shortly afterwards, 20,000 ethnic Germans from the city were expelled into Allied-occupied Austria. After the 1948 Czechoslovak coup d\\'état, the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic abolished Moravian autonomy and Brno thus ceased to be the capital of Moravia. Since then Moravia has been divided into administrative regions, with Brno the administrative centre of the South Moravian Region. In the 1960s and 1970s, large panel housing estates were built in border districts, such as Bohunice, Líšeň, Bystrc, and Vinohrady. During the communist era, most of the workforce was employed in industry, mainly machinery.

Economy: Since 1990, many companies created or spun off as part of privatization from former national enterprises have disappeared. Before 1990, engineering companies were very important in Brno; since then, the city\\'s economy has largely reoriented itself towards light industry, logistics, and services. The city later gained importance in other fields of engineering, especially in software development. After 2000, foreign technology companies began establishing their branches in Brno, and many Czech companies with local or global reach were also founded here. Companies operating in Brno include Gen Digital (one of the headquarters, brand AVG Technologies still used), Kyndryl (Client Innovation Centre), AT&T, Honeywell (Global Design Center), Siemens, Red Hat (Czech headquarters), an office of Zebra Technologies, and formerly Silicon Graphics International (Czech headquarters). In recent years, the quaternary sector of the economy, i.e., activities in science, research, and education, has also begun to develop in Brno. Examples include AdMaS (Advanced Materials, Structures, and Technologies) or CETOCOEN (Center for Research on Toxic Substances in the Environment). The city cultivates this sector via supporting organisations such as the South Moravian Innovation Centre and the VUT Technology Incubator.

If self-employment is your main economic activity, the amount paid in contributions depends on your income, but the minimum is 2,722 CZK/month (2023).

The health care contribution is 13.5% of the assessment base. In most cases – where the lump sum for expenses is 60% – this effectively amounts to about 2.7% of the income.

Brno, under the leadership of Jean-Louis Raduit de Souches, successfully defended itself against the Swedish army led by General Lennart Torstenson and became the sole capital of the Margraviate of Moravia. After the war, this status was confirmed by Emperor Joseph II in 1782 and the Moravian constitution in 1849. The Moravian Land Tables, a part of the national cultural sights, are now stored in the Moravian Regional Archive. Špilberk Castle was transformed into a baroque citadel during the 17th century. In 1742, Brno repelled a siege by the Prussian Army under Frederick the Great. The bishopric of Brno was established in 1777 with Mathias Franz Graf von Chorinsky Freiherr von Ledske as its first bishop.

Each foreigner who wants to stay here for more than 3 months must be medically insured in the CR. There are two types of health insurance – public and commercial. Public health insurance is a public service not intended for the profit of the Czech government, hence it provides much better value both financially and in terms of health security. It offers expansive coverage of medical expenses without limits and ensures continuous coverage as they cannot cancel or refuse to extend insurance if you meet the required conditions. On the other hand, commercial health insurance offers more flexibility to insurance companies to profit, generally comes with a lower monthly premium, but provides limited medical coverage. The restrictions on coverage can lead to higher out-of-pocket expenses and more administrative procedures for both patients and doctors. A significant risk with commercial insurance is that the provider may terminate a policy or refuse renewal if the policyholder becomes too costly. The choice of adopting either a public or commercial insurance plan is fixed based on nationality or personal/economical situations and cannot be changed at will. Meanwhile, the city of Brno is engaging in research to enhance support and public policies based on the needs of internationals living in the region, and invites participation in the Great Brno Expat Survey 2023 to contribute to these developments.\",\"brief\":\"In the Czech Republic, being medically insured is a legal requirement for all foreigners staying over three months, offering both public and commercial options.
