This was due to Olomouc being a primary target of Swedish armies because of its Collegium Nordicum. In 1642, Olomouc surrendered to the Swedish Army, which occupied it for eight years. Brno became the sole capital of the Margraviate of Moravia and retained this status after the Thirty Years' War in 1648. The Moravian Land Tables are now stored in the Moravian Regional Archive in Brno and are recognized as national cultural sights of the Czech Republic. Špilberk Castle was rebuilt as a baroque citadel during the 17th century. Brno was besieged by the Prussian Army in 1742 under Frederick the Great, but the siege was unsuccessful. The bishopric of Brno was established in 1777 by the Catholic Church. In December 1805, the Battle of Austerlitz, also known as the 'Battle of the Three Emperors', was fought near the city; Napoleon Bonaparte spent several nights in Brno both during and after the battle. The first train arrived in Brno from Vienna in 1839, marking the beginning of rail transport in what is now the Czech Republic. The city fortifications were almost completely removed between 1859-1864, and a horsecar service started operating in Brno in 1869, which was later replaced by the first tram service in the country. Gregor Mendel conducted his groundbreaking experiments in genetics while he was a monk at St. Thomas's Abbey in Brno during the 1850s.\" brief=\"Brno's historical development includes its rise as the sole capital of Moravia after the Thirty Years' War, the establishment of the bishopric by the Catholic Church, and the beginning of rail transport.

According to this legend, a terrible creature was terrorizing the citizens of Brno. The people had never seen this animal before, so they called it a dragon. They lived in fear of the dragon until one citizen managed to kill the monster by tricking it into eating a carcass filled with lime. In reality the dragon was a crocodile, the preserved body of which is now displayed at the entrance of the Old Town Hall. Crocodile and dragon motifs are common in Brno. A crocodile (Czech: krokodýl) is the local stuffed baguette, and the city radio station is known as Radio Krokodýl. The local basebal team is named Draci Brno (English: Brno Dragons) and the local rugby club is named RC Dragon Brno. There is also a local American football team called the Brno Alligators. Next to the 'dragon' at the Old Town Hall is the town's second well-known emblem, a wagon wheel made from a tree found and cut down 50 miles from the city. According to the legend, a local man made a wager that he could fell the tree, make a wheel out of it, and roll the wheel to the City of Brno, all within a single day. Since the achievement was deemed to be impossible by normal human means, the man was believed to have called on the devil for assistance, and died in poverty as a result. Another local legend relates to the siege of the city by Swedish forces in 1645. The locals and the Swedish army were in a stalemate, and the Swedish general declared that he would withdraw if his army had not won by noon. The bell ringer at Petrov Cathedral tricked him by ringing the bell an hour early, and keeping his word, the general and his army left. As a historic tribute to the event, the bell at Petrov Cathedral still rings for noon an hour earlier, at 11 o'clock. At this time, the Brno astronomical clock also releases a glass ball as a souvenir.\" brief=\"This article explores various legends associated with Brno, Czech Republic. These include the Legend of the Brno Dragon, which suggests that a dragon-like creature was terrorizing citizens, and a legend about a local man who called on the devil's help to make a wheel and roll it to the City of Brno within a day.

At least another 960 people, mostly of mixed race, followed in 1943 and 1944. After Terezín, many of them were sent to Auschwitz concentration camp, Minsk Ghetto, Rejowiec and other ghettos and concentration camps. Although Terezín was not an extermination camp, 995 people transported from Brno died there. Only 1,033 people returned after the war. Industrial facilities such as the Československá zbrojovka arms factory and the Zweigwerk aircraft engine factory (which became Zbrojovka's subsidiary Zetor after the war) and the city centre were targeted by several Allied bombardment campaigns between 1944 and 1945. The air strikes and later artillery fire killed some 1,200 people and destroyed 1,278 buildings. After the city's occupation by the Red Army on 26 April 1945 and the end of the war, ethnic German residents were expelled. In the Brno death march, beginning on 31 May 1945, about 27,000 German inhabitants of Brno were marched 64 kilometres (40 miles) to the Austrian border. According to testimony collected by German sources, about 5,200 of them died during the march. Later estimates by Czech sources put the death toll at about 1,700, with most deaths due to an epidemic of shigellosis. After the reestablishment of an independent Czechoslovak state after World War II, Prime Minister Edvard Beneš delivered a speech in Brno demanding the expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia. Shortly afterwards, 20,000 ethnic Germans from the city were expelled into Allied-occupied Austria. After the 1948 Czechoslovak coup d'état, the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic abolished Moravian autonomy and Brno thus ceased to be the capital of Moravia. Since then Moravia has been divided into administrative regions, with Brno the administrative centre of the South Moravian Region. In 1960s and 1970s, large panel housing estates were built in border districts, such as Bohunice, Líšeň, Bystrc and Vinohrady. During the communist era, most of the workforce was employed in industry, mainly machinery.

The current main railway station is the central hub of regional train services, used by about 50,000 passengers every day, with around 500 trains passing through. The station is currently operating at full capacity; the main station building is outdated and lacks sufficient operating capacity, but the construction of the new station has been postponed several times for various reasons.\\nBrno is also an international road transport crossroads. There are two motorways on the southern edge of the city: the D1 leading to Ostrava and Prague, and the D2 leading to Bratislava. Not far from the city limits is the D52 motorway leading to Vienna. Another planned motorway, the D43, will connect Brno to northwestern Moravia.\\nThe city is gradually building the large city ring road (road I/42). Several road tunnels have been built at Pisarky, Husovice, Hlinky, and Královo pole, and more are planned.\\nDue to the congestion in private transport, the city is continuing to try to build more parking ramps, including underground, but these efforts have not always been successful.\\nAir transport is enabled by two functional airports. The public international airport, Brno–Tuřany Airport, saw a sharp increase in passenger traffic up to 2011, however the number of passengers declined in the following years, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. The airport also serves as one of the two bases for police helicopters in the Czech Republic. The other airport, Medlánky Airport, is a small domestic airport serving mainly recreational activities such as flying hot air balloons, gliders or aircraft RC models.\\nCycling is widespread in Brno due to lowland nature of the landscape. Existing tracks for cycling and roller skating in 2011 totalled approximately 38 kilometres (24 mi), and are gradually being expanded.

If you are planning to stay in the Czech Republic for over 90 days, you need to obtain a long-term visa or a long-term residence. Applicants for the visa have to specify a purpose for their stay in the Czech Republic and apply for the appropriate visa at Embassy of the Czech Republic. The purpose of stay might be employment, business, scientific research, studies, family reunification, culture or other. The Czech Embassy is only authorized to receive an application for a long-term visa; the competent authority for processing it is the Ministry of Interior (MOI). During the procedure, the Czech Embassy communicates with you, invites you for a hearing and calls on you to pick up the visa. Please note that the competent authority for processing your long-term visa or a long-term residency is the Ministry of Interior (MOI). You can apply for a long-term visa for a purpose of family or a long-term residence for a purpose of family reunification. An application for a long-term visa or residence for the purpose of family reunification can primarily be filed by a foreign national who is a spouse or a child of a foreign national (non-EU) who is already in possession of a long-term residence (i.e. employee card) or permanent residence permit in the Czech Republic. However, a spouse or a child can apply for visa or residence permit at the same time with the person they are reunification with. You should file an application for a long-term visa at Embassy of the Czech Republic. For the complete list and requirements contact your local Czech embassy or visit the Immigration office website. If you are a family member (spouse, partner, child, parent) of an EU citizen, you can apply for a temporary residence permit. An application can be filled in person at any MOI (Ministry of Inferior) office in the Czech Republic within 3 months of entering the country (i.e. Schengen visa). For the complete list and requirements visit the Immigration office website.' brief='This text provides information on permit requirements for staying over 90 days in the Czech Republic for non-EU citizens, including long-term visas and residence permits for family reunification.

There are two types of health insurance - public and commercial. The public health insurance is a public service not intended for profit, offering better value for your pocket and security for your health with no limits for medical expenses coverage. Commercial health insurance is less strictly controlled, giving insurance companies more room to benefit from the people insured. However, it has lower coverage limits, more paperwork for doctors, and the risk of the company ditching policyholders when they become too expensive. The type of health insurance is determined by nationality or personal/economic situation and cannot be switched between systems at will.\\nPhoto by Jirka Lubojacky.' brief='The article explains two types of health insurance in the Czech Republic for foreigners staying more than 3 months: public and commercial.

In order to buy it, just click on 'Buy a ticket' button on the left side of the eshop. First you need to add a ticket carrier by using button 'Add a new ticket carrier' and then select him with 'Select a carrier'. Next step is selecting a ticket itself and when you’re done, confirm it with 'Select' button. As the last step you have to select a date and time when the validity of the ticket should start. You can select any date including the day when you are buying it, up to 30 days in advance. This step is confirmed using 'Add to cart button' and then you have to confirm the whole selection with 'Proceed to checkout' button. Now you can select the method of payment. You can select either the option of paying using GoPay that enables you to pay using internet banking of some banks, or you can pay via bank card online. If you don’t want to use this method, you can select the second one, but only if your transportation card begins its validity in 5 or more working days. This method is called Pay via OFFLINE bank transfer. If you’ll select GoPay, your payment will only need to be confirmed – you don’t need to fill anything in it. As for the second method, you’ll obtain data needed to make the payment.\\nAttention: if you need to transfer this ticket to another carrier, this is limited by the number of immediate transfers (for short-term transfers to two, up to six for one-year portable salvia). Further transfers, after the immediate transfer limit is exceeded, are only possible with a 10-minute delay, after which the required transfer will need to be finally confirmed.\" brief=\"This text explains the process of purchasing a transferable public transport ticket in Brno. One can create an account on BrnoID.cz's eshop using just an email address and password. After selecting the desired ticket type and adding a ticket carrier, one can confirm the selection and proceed to checkout. The payment for the ticket can be made via internet banking or bank card online with GoPay option being instantaneous.\" address='Brno, Czech Republic'\n"

Both born in 1934. Both students during the challenging 1950s in Czechoslovakia. Both classmates of Jana Horáková – the daughter of Milada Horáková, probably the most famous victim of communistic political monster-processes in Czechoslovakia.\\nThanks to autoteatro, you might experience for a while what it felt like to be in their skin, and you will be able to imagine what they had to go through.\\nWhat is Autoteatro? Autoteatro is a specific form of theater that engages participants in an immersive and interactive experience. In Autoteatro, individuals become both the actors and the audience, blurring the traditional boundaries between performer and spectator. Audience is entering the skin of protagonists of the play, becoming its main characters.\\nAutoteatro takes place directly in a café during regular opening hours. Participants receive headphones through which they receive all the instructions. The experience is also guided by specially trained actors who enhance the overall atmosphere of the play.\\nAbout the play Troublesome Classmates\\nIn the play Troublesome Classmates, you will immerse in the lives of two contemporaries of the communist revolution in Czechoslovakia – Jana Kaněrová and Zdeněk Adamec. They experienced the times of World War II, collectivization, and time of fabricated political trials. How do they remember that era? What was it like growing up in a time when one had to be a communist or face repressions that could cost one’s life?\\nBoth Kaněrová and Adamec shared their memories with the Institute of National Memory. Students from JAMU (Janáček Academy of Performing Arts), under the guidance of Monika Okurková, transformed these memories into immersive theater for two spectators.\\nFor each performance, we expect 2 participants, a man and a woman. They will sit at a table in a café (or a similar space), wearing headphones that will allow them to immerse in the story and take on the roles of Jana Kaněrová or Zdeněk Adamec, experiencing at least partially what they went through years ago. Trained actors will assist them throughout the process.' brief=\"AUTOTEATRO: Troublesome Classmates is an immersive performance for two people, a man and a woman, who experience life in communist Czechoslovakia through Jana Kaněrová and Zdeněk Adamec's memories.

An incredibly sophisticated systems of backdrops and drapes enriches the spectators’ visual delight.\\nThe peculiar owner of an inn in Florence, as we know her from Carlo Goldoni’s comedy, is a very competent woman who is more versed in business than anybody else. Both the pub and the rooms are always full and many clients long to win her affection. Some of them let it show rather ostentatiously, such as the impoverished yet boastful Marquis Di Forlipopoli and the upstart, self-centred Earl d’Albafiorit. Even though serving such importunate admirers might seem amusing, the lively innkeeper finds their obtuseness gruelling. Being a jovial person, she sits up and takes notice when baron Di Ripafratta – a sworn adversary of women – walks into her pub. Mirandolina is closely bound to the starring actress Tereza Groszmannová, whose translation of the play is custom-made both for herself and her fellow actors.

But maybe at some other place or at some other time … After the decease of their father, who provided the whole family with financial support and maintained its thriving social life, the three sisters – Irina, Masha and Olga – are left all by themselves in their small town and their future is far from being bright. The family house, which used to be attended by renowned guests, now attracts merely eccentrics and outsiders. Soon, their brother dissipates the bequest and the necessity of earning their living makes them loose what aristocrats took for granted: free time. Their desire to live a happy and fuller life, their longing for love and for a new home leads the sisters into extreme situations. Bitter laughter, laughable tears – what seems to be ordinary fortunes of common people unlocks great stories of love and adversity. Three Sisters , one of the two plays that Anton Pavlovich Chekhov (1860–1904) wrote specifically for the Moscow Art Theater, is considered to be the Russian playwright’s masterpiece. The four-act drama had a significant impact on European theater, including the Czech one: performed by the Moscow ensemble in Prague in 1906 it revolutionized the local approach to modern acting and directing. In Brno, Three Sisters will be staged by Štěpán Pácl, in-house director of the Dramatic Company of the National Theater Brno, whose successful production of Chekhov’s play The Seagull was adapted into film.' brief=\"The play 'Three Sisters' by Anton Pavlovich Chekhov is going to be performed at Mahen Theatre in Brno, exploring themes of love, longing for a new home and the desire to live a happy life.

In 1642 Olomouc surrendered to the Swedish Army, which occupied it for eight years. Meanwhile, Brno, as the only Moravian city which, under the leadership of Jean-Louis Raduit de Souches, succeeded in defending itself from the Swedes under General Lennart Torstenson, served as the sole capital of the Margraviate of Moravia.

According to this legend, a terrible creature was terrorizing the citizens of Brno. The people had never seen this animal before, so they called it a dragon. They lived in fear of the dragon until one citizen managed to kill the monster by tricking it into eating a carcass filled with lime. In reality the dragon was a crocodile, the preserved body of which is now displayed at the entrance of the Old Town Hall. Crocodile and dragon motifs are common in Brno. A crocodile (Czech: krokodýl) is the local stuffed baguette, and the city radio station is known as Radio Krokodýl. The local baseball team is named Draci Brno (English: Brno Dragons) and the local rugby club is named RC Dragon Brno. There is also a local American football team called the Brno Alligators. An Intercity train connecting Brno and Prague is called Brněnský drak (English: The Brno dragon). Next to the \"dragon\" at the Old Town Hall is the town\\'s second well-known emblem, a wagon wheel made from a tree found and cut down 50 miles from the city. According to the legend, a local man made a wager that he could fell the tree, make a wheel out of it, and roll the wheel to the City of Brno, all within a single day. Since the achievement was deemed to be impossible by normal human means, the man was believed to have called on the devil for assistance, and died in poverty as a result. Another local legend relates to the siege of the city by Swedish forces in 1645. The locals and the Swedish army were in a stalemate, and the Swedish general declared that he would withdraw if his army had not won by noon. The bell ringer at Petrov Cathedral tricked him by ringing the bell an hour early, and keeping his word, the general and his army left. As a historic tribute to the event, the bell at Petrov Cathedral still rings for noon an hour earlier, at 11 o\\'clock. At this time, the Brno astronomical clock also releases a glass ball as a souvenir.

Brno was first mentioned in Cosmas\\' Chronica Boemorum dated to the year 1091, when Bohemian king Vratislaus II besieged his brother Conrad at Brno castle. In the mid 11th century, Moravia was divided into three separate territories; each had its own ruler, coming from the Přemyslids dynasty, but independent of the other two, and subordinate only to the Bohemian ruler in Prague. The seats of these rulers and thus the \"capitals\" of these territories were the castles and towns of Brno, Olomouc, and Znojmo. In the late 12th century, Moravia began to reunify, forming the Margraviate of Moravia. From then until the mid of the 17th century, it was not clear which town should be the capital of Moravia. Political power was divided between Brno and Olomouc, but Znojmo also played an important role. The Moravian Diet, the Moravian Land Tables, and the Moravian Land Court were all seated in both cities at once. However, Brno was the official seat of the Moravian Margraves (rulers of Moravia), and later its geographical position closer to Vienna also became important. Otherwise, until 1642 Olomouc had a larger population than Brno, and was the seat of the only Roman Catholic diocese in Moravia. In 1243 Brno was granted the large and small city privileges by the King, and was thus recognized as a royal city. As throughout Eastern Central Europe, the granting of city privileges was connected with immigration from German-speaking lands. In 1324 Queen Elisabeth Richeza of Poland founded the Basilica of the Assumption of Our Lady, which now houses her grave. In the 14th century, Brno became one of the centres for the Moravian regional assemblies, whose meetings alternated between Brno and Olomouc. These assemblies made political, legal, and financial decisions. Brno and Olomouc were also the seats of the Land Court and the Moravian Land Tables, thus they were the two most important cities in Moravia. From the mid 14th century to the early 15th century, Špilberk Castle had served as the permanent seat of the Margraves of Moravia; one of them was elected the King of the Romans. Brno was besieged in 1428 and again in 1430 by the Hussites during the Hussite Wars. Both attempts to conquer the city failed.' brief=\"Brno was established as a castle in the early 11th century and became one of the centres of Moravia.

In 1921 Brno became the capital of the Land of Moravia and seven years later, Brno became the capital of the Land of Moravia-Silesia.

At least another 960 people, mostly of mixed race, followed in 1943 and 1944. After Terezín, many of them were sent to Auschwitz concentration camp, Minsk Ghetto, Rejowiec and other ghettos and concentration camps. Although Terezín was not an extermination camp, 995 people transported from Brno died there. Only 1,033 people returned after the war. Industrial facilities such as the Československá zbrojovka arms factory and the Zweigwerk aircraft engine factory (which became Zbrojovka's subsidiary Zetor after the war) and the city centre were targeted by several Allied bombardment campaigns between 1944 and 1945. The air strikes and later artillery fire killed some 1,200 people and destroyed 1,278 buildings. After the city's occupation by the Red Army on 26 April 1945 and the end of the war, ethnic German residents were expelled. In the Brno death march, beginning on 31 May 1945, about 27,000 German inhabitants of Brno were marched 64 kilometres (40 miles) to the Austrian border. According to testimony collected by German sources, about 5,200 of them died during the march. Later estimates by Czech sources put the death toll at about 1,700, with most deaths due to an epidemic of shigellosis. After the reestablishment of an independent Czechoslovak state after World War II, Prime Minister Edvard Beneš delivered a speech in Brno demanding the expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia. Shortly afterwards, 20,000 ethnic Germans from the city were expelled into Allied-occupied Austria. After the 1948 Czechoslovak coup d'état, the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic abolished Moravian autonomy and Brno thus ceased to be the capital of Moravia. Since then Moravia has been divided into administrative regions, with Brno the administrative centre of the South Moravian Region. In 1960s and 1970s, large panel housing estates were built in border districts, such as Bohunice, Líšeň, Bystrc and Vinohrady. During the communist era, most of the workforce was employed in industry, mainly machinery.

The era between the world wars saw a building boom to the city, leaving it with many modern and especially functionalist buildings, the most celebrated being Villa Tugendhat, designed by architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe in the 1920s for the wealthy family of Fritz Tugendhat, and finished in 1930. It was designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 2001. Another renowned architect who significantly shaped Brno was Arnošt Wiesner. Other functionalist buildings include the Avion Hotel and Morava Palace. The Brno Exhibition Centre is the city's main attraction for international business visitors, visited by over one million visitors each year, and hosting over 40 professional trade fairs and business conferences. Lužánky is the oldest public park in the Czech Republic, established in the late 18th century by the emperor of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Denis Gardens were founded in the early 19th century and were the first public park in the present-day Czech Republic founded by public authorities. Špilberk Park is classified as a national cultural sight of the Czech Republic, as a unique piece of landscape architecture. One of Brno's more recent additions is the Brno astronomical clock. The AZ Tower, opened in 2013 and 111 metres (364 ft) tall, is currently the tallest building in the Czech Republic.\" brief=\"Brno is a city with rich Jewish history, featuring a functionalist synagogue and largest Jewish cemetery in Moravia.

The first theatre plays in Brno probably took place in the 1660s in the City Tavern, today\\'s Reduta Theatre; however, the first theatre with boxes was built in this complex in 1733. The first documented professional Czech performance took place in 1767, again in the Reduta Theatre; the play was called Zamilovaný ponocný (English: Watchman in Love) and was performed by the Venice Theatre Company. The same year, Mozart performed in the theatre with his elder sister Anna Maria (Nannerl). In that year the Mozart family spent Christmas in Brno, and their visit is commemorated by a statue of Mozart as a child in front of the Reduta Theatre. The theatre\\'s Mozart Hall was also named after him. The Národní divadlo v Brně (English: National Theatre of Brno; NdB) is the leading producer of opera, drama, and ballet in the city of Brno. The first permanent seat of NdB was established in 1884, and today this institution owns the Mahen Theatre, built in 1882, Janáček Theatre, built in 1965, and the Reduta Theatre. The composer Leoš Janáček is also connected with the National Theatre of Brno. The Mahen Theatre was the first theatre building in Europe to be illuminated by Thomas Edison\\'s electric light bulbs; at that time it was a completely new invention and there were no power plants built in the city, so a small steam power plant was built nearby just to power the theatre, and Edison came to Brno in 1911 to see it. The most commercially successful theatre in Brno is the Brno City Theatre, founded in 1945; its performances are usually sold out. They also stage about 150 performances abroad every year. The theatre\\'s repertoire consists primarily of musical and dramatic shows.

Today, Brno is a transnational railway hub, with nine stations for passenger traffic. The current main railway station is the central hub of regional train services, used by about 50,000 passengers every day, with around 500 trains passing through. The station is currently operating at full capacity; the main station building is outdated and lacks sufficient operating capacity, but the construction of the new station has been postponed several times for various reasons. A referendum over whether to move the station was held on 7 and 8 October 2016, coinciding with regional elections. Brno is also an international road transport crossroads. There are two motorways on the southern edge of the city: the D1 leading to Ostrava and Prague, and the D2 leading to Bratislava. Not far from the city limits is the D52 motorway leading to Vienna. Another planned motorway, the D43, will connect Brno to northwestern Moravia. The city is gradually building the large city ring road (road I/42). Several road tunnels have been built at Pisarky, Husovice, Hlinky, and Královo pole, and more are planned. Due to the congestion in private transport, the city is continuing to try to build more parking ramps, including underground, but these efforts have not always been successful. Air transport is enabled by two functional airports. The public international airport, Brno–Tuřany Airport, saw a sharp increase in passenger traffic up to 2011, however the number of passengers declined in the following years, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. The airport also serves as one of the two bases for police helicopters in the Czech Republic. The other airport, Medlánky Airport, is a small domestic airport serving mainly recreational activities such as flying hot air balloons, gliders or aircraft RC models. Cycling is widespread in Brno due to lowland nature of the landscape. Existing tracks for cycling and roller skating in 2011 totalled approximately 38 kilometres (24 mi), and are gradually being expanded. There is also one long bikeway leading to Vienna, approximately 130 kilometres (81 mi) long.

Perhaps you wouldn´t expect this genre from a composer of famous tragic operas, but there you would be wrong, as in actual fact Verdi wanted to write a comedy all his life, but only got round to it with his last opera. And so a masterpiece inspired by the famous Shakespearean figure, Sir John Falstaff, was created.\\n\\nFalstaff, a resident of the Garter Inn, enjoys partaking of good food and drink, but is particularly interested in the local Windsor ladies Alice Ford and Meg Page. The fact that they are both married doesn´t bother him at all; on the contrary, it only adds spice to his desires. Meg and Alice don´t care for his affections, and, with the help of Mistress Quicky, entangle him in their webs and teach him a proper lesson. However, Falstaff concludes this bittersweet comedy with the wise words: “The whole world is a farce.” Verdi, who had experienced a lot himself and knew how to enjoy life, left the world a comic opera that is hard to match. Smart and witty, with occasional subtle parodies of Verdi´s typical heroic performances, full of ensemble numbers which are clearly inspired by Rossini, and with humour overflowing with understanding for all that is human, such is his Falstaff that is returning to the Brno stage after fifty years away.' brief=\"A comedy opera by Giuseppe Verdi, staged by Ondřej Havelka, telling the story of Sir John Falstaff's adventures with Windsor ladies.

Audience is entering the skin of protagonists of the play, becoming its main characters.\\nAutoteatro takes place directly in a café during regular opening hours. Participants receive headphones through which they receive all the instructions. The experience is also guided by specially trained actors who enhance the overall atmosphere of the play.\\nAbout the play Troublesome Classmates\\nIn the play Troublesome Classmates, you will immerse in the lives of two contemporaries of the communist revolution in Czechoslovakia – Jana Kaněrová and Zdeněk Adamec. They experienced the times of World War II, collectivization, and time of fabricated political trials. How do they remember that era? What was it like growing up in a time when one had to be a communist or face repressions that could cost one’s life?\\nBoth Kaněrová and Adamec shared their memories with the Institute of National Memory. Students from JAMU (Janáček Academy of Performing Arts), under the guidance of Monika Okurková, transformed these memories into immersive theater for two spectators.\\nFor each performance, we expect 2 participants, a man and a woman. They will sit at a table in a café (or a similar space), wearing headphones that will allow them to immerse in the story and take on the roles of Jana Kaněrová or Zdeněk Adamec, experiencing at least partially what they went through years ago.

The family house, which used to be attended by renowned guests, now attracts merely eccentrics and outsiders.

Their desire to live a happy and fuller life, their longing for love and for a new home leads the sisters into extreme situations. Bitter laughter, laughable tears – what seems to be ordinary fortunes of common people unlocks great stories of love and adversity. Three Sisters , one of the two plays that Anton Pavlovich Chekhov (1860–1904) wrote specifically for the Moscow Art Theater, is considered to be the Russian playwright’s masterpiece. The four-act drama had a significant impact on European theater, including the Czech one: performed by the Moscow ensemble in Prague in 1906 it revolutionized the local approach to modern acting and directing. In Brno, Three Sisters will be staged by Štěpán Pácl, in-house director of the Dramatic Company of the National Theater Brno, whose successful production of Chekhov’s play The Seagull was adapted into film.' brief=\"The three sisters Irina, Masha and Olga are left alone in their small town after their father's death.

The Employee card is a single permit to stay in the Czech Republic for the purpose of employment and to perform work in the job, for which the card was issued. You must file the written application in person at your local Embassy of the Czech Republic. If you are already staying in the territory of the Czech Republic on a visa for a stay over 90 days or on a long term residence permit for some other purpose, you can file the application with the Czech Immigration office (MOI). The folder for the application will need to contain i.e. the employment contract, proof of accommodation in Brno, professional qualification or diploma, criminal record, a photograph. For the complete list and requirements contact your local Embassy of the Czech Republic or visit the Immigration office website. When your application is approved, the embassy will issue a visa for the purpose of collecting your employee card (D/VR). Before the visa is issued, you will be asked to submit a travel health insurance valid for the period from the date of entry into the CR to the date on which you are to start working. You will automatically join the public health insurance system on the day you start working. After the arrival to the CR, you have to visit the Immigration Office (MOI) within 3 working days and pick up your employee card.' brief='Learn how to apply for a visa and Employee card in the Czech Republic.

Brno was first mentioned in Cosmas\\' Chronica Boemorum dated to the year 1091, when Bohemian king Vratislaus II besieged his brother Conrad at Brno castle.\\n\\nIn the mid 11th century, Moravia was divided into three separate territories; each had its own ruler, coming from the Přemyslids dynasty, but independent of the other two, and subordinate only to the Bohemian ruler in Prague. The seats of these rulers and thus the \"capitals\" of these territories were the castles and towns of Brno, Olomouc, and Znojmo.\\n\\nIn the late 12th century, Moravia began to reunify, forming the Margraviate of Moravia. From then until the mid of the 17th century, it was not clear which town should be the capital of Moravia. Political power was divided between Brno and Olomouc, but Znojmo also played an important role. The Moravian Diet, the Moravian Land Tables, and the Moravian Land Court were all seated in both cities at once.\\n\\nHowever, Brno was the official seat of the Moravian Margraves (rulers of Moravia), and later its geographical position closer to Vienna also became important. Otherwise, until 1642 Olomouc had a larger population than Brno, and was the seat of the only Roman Catholic diocese in Moravia.\\n\\nIn 1243 Brno was granted the large and small city privileges by the King, and was thus recognized as a royal city. As throughout Eastern Central Europe, the granting of city privileges was connected with immigration from German-speaking lands.\\n\\nIn 1324 Queen Elisabeth Richeza of Poland founded the Basilica of the Assumption of Our Lady, which now houses her grave.\\n\\nIn the 14th century, Brno became one of the centres for the Moravian regional assemblies, whose meetings alternated between Brno and Olomouc. These assemblies made political, legal, and financial decisions. Brno and Olomouc were also the seats of the Land Court and the Moravian Land Tables, thus they were the two most important cities in Moravia.\\n\\nFrom the mid 14th century to the early 15th century, Špilberk Castle had served as the permanent seat of the Margraves of Moravia; one of them was elected the King of the Romans. Brno was besieged in 1428 and again in 1430 by the Hussites during the Hussite Wars. Both attempts to conquer the city failed.' brief=\"Brno's early history began with its establishment as a castle in the 11th century. It became one of the three centres of Moravia, along with Olomouc and Znojmo, before reunifying into the Margraviate of Moravia. The city played an important role in the Moravian regional assemblies and was granted royal city privileges in 1243.\"\n"

At least another 960 people, mostly of mixed race, followed in 1943 and 1944. After Terezín, many of them were sent to Auschwitz concentration camp, Minsk Ghetto, Rejowiec and other ghettos and concentration camps. Although Terezín was not an extermination camp, 995 people transported from Brno died there. Only 1,033 people returned after the war. Industrial facilities such as the Československá zbrojovka arms factory and the Zweigwerk aircraft engine factory (which became Zbrojovka's subsidiary Zetor after the war) and the city centre were targeted by several Allied bombardment campaigns between 1944 and 1945. The air strikes and later artillery fire killed some 1,200 people and destroyed 1,278 buildings. After the city's occupation by the Red Army on April 26, 1945 and the end of the war, ethnic German residents were expelled. In the Brno death march, beginning on May 31, 1945, about 27,000 German inhabitants of Brno were marched 64 kilometres (40 miles) to the Austrian border. According to testimony collected by German sources, about 5,200 of them died during the march. Later estimates by Czech sources put the death toll at about 1,700, with most deaths due to an epidemic of shigellosis. After the reestablishment of an independent Czechoslovak state after World War II, Prime Minister Edvard Beneš delivered a speech in Brno demanding the expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia. Shortly afterwards, 20,000 ethnic Germans from the city were expelled into Allied-occupied Austria. After the 1948 Czechoslovak coup d'état, the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic abolished Moravian autonomy and Brno thus ceased to be the capital of Moravia. Since then Moravia has been divided into administrative regions, with Brno the administrative centre of the South Moravian Region. In 1960s and 1970s, large panel housing estates were built in border districts, such as Bohunice, Líšeň, Bystrc and Vinohrady. During the communist era, most of the workforce was employed in industry, mainly machinery. After 1989, part of the workforce switched from industry to services, and Brno became the IT centre of the Czech Republic. Nevertheless, new industrial zones were built at the edge of the city, such as Černovická terasa in the east of the city.\" brief=\"Brno's history includes World War II deportations, Allied bombardments, post-war expulsions, and division into administrative regions.\"\n"

However, there is a considerable difference in the number of historical preservation zones of both cities. While Brno has 484 legally protected sites, Prague has as many as 1,330.\\nŠpilberk Castle, originally a royal castle founded in the 13th century, was from the 17th century a fortress and feared prison (e.g. Carbonari). Today it is one of the city's principal monuments.\\nAnother key landmark is the Cathedral of St. Peter and Paul, built during the 14th and 15th centuries in place of an 11th-century chapel. Its present form with two neo-Gothic towers was completed in 1909. The other large castle near the city is Veveří Castle.\\nThe Abbey of Saint Thomas was the site of Gregor Mendel's experiments establishing the new science of genetics.\\nThe Church of Saint Tomas houses the tomb of its founder, John Henry and his son Jobst of Moravia, Margraves of Moravia. The Basilica of the Assumption of Our Lady houses the grave of its founder Queen Elisabeth Richeza.\\nThe Church of Saint James is one of the best preserved and most spectacular Gothic churches in Brno.\\nBrno Ossuary is the second largest ossuary in Europe, after the Catacombs of Paris.

The city later gained importance in other fields of engineering, especially in software development. After 2000, foreign technology companies began establishing their branches in Brno, and many Czech companies with local or global reach were also founded here. Companies operating in Brno include Gen Digital (one of the headquarters, brand AVG Technologies still used), Kyndryl (Client Innovation Centre), AT&T, Honeywell (Global Design Center), Siemens, Red Hat (Czech headquarters), an office of Zebra Technologies, and formerly Silicon Graphics International (Czech headquarters). In recent years, the quaternary sector of the economy, i.e., activities in science, research, and education, has also begun to develop in Brno. Examples include AdMaS (Advanced Materials, Structures, and Technologies) or CETOCOEN (Center for Research on Toxic Substances in the Environment). The city cultivates this sector via supporting organisations such as the South Moravian Innovation Centre and the VUT Technology Incubator. The city has a long association with motor racing; among other events, the Masaryk Circuit has hosted the Moto GP championship since 1965. The annual Czech Republic motorcycle Grand Prix, the most famous motor race in the Czech Republic, has been held in the city since 1950. Since 1968, Brno has been a permanent fixture on the European Touring Car Championship (ETCC) series.\" brief='Janáček Academy of Music and Performing Arts is an institution that hosts an annual competition named after Leoš Janáček, and is one of two academies of music and drama in the Czech Republic. The city also has a strong association with motor racing, hosting various events including the Moto GP championship and the Czech Republic motorcycle Grand Prix.'\n"

      "Response: header='Brno' text=\"Track and road cycling have a long history in Brno. The first track races took place here in 1889, and the velodrome in Brno ranks among the oldest velodromes in the world. In 1969 Brno hosted the UCI Track Cycling World Championships and UCI Road World Championships for amateurs, in 1981 the UCI Track Cycling World Championships and in 2001 the UEC European Track Championships for the U23 category. There are two traditional cycling teams: TJ Favorit Brno and Dukla Brno. The 2010 FIBA World Championship for Women was played in Brno's Arena Vodova, with the Czech squad taking the silver medal. There is a horse-race course at Brno-Dvorská and an aeroclub airport in Medlánky. Several sports clubs represent the city in the various Czech leagues, including FC Zbrojovka Brno (football), HC Kometa Brno (ice hockey), KP Brno (handball), BC Brno (basketball, men) and BK Brno (women), four baseball teams (Draci Brno, Hroši Brno, VSK Technika Brno, MZLU Express Brno), Brno Ravens Lacrosse Club (lacrosse), Brno Alligators (American football), two rugby teams (RC Dragon Brno, RC Bystrc) and others. Tennis players Barbora Krejčíková, Lucie Šafářová, Lukáš Rosol, and Jana Novotná are from Brno, as well as Michal Březina, one of the top Czech figure skaters. Motorcycle speedway events were held at the Winter Stadium, off Na Rybníčku in Králové Pole. The venue hosted a final round of the Czechoslovak Individual Speedway Championship in 1949, 1950 and 1954. Public transport in Brno consists of 12 tram lines, 14 trolleybus lines (the largest trolleybus network in the Czech Republic) and almost 40 day and 11 night bus lines. Trams (known locally as šaliny) first appeared on the streets in 1869; this was the first operation of horse-drawn trams in the modern-day Czech Republic. The local public transport system is interconnected with regional public transport in one integrated system (IDS JMK), and directly connects several nearby municipalities with the city. Its main operator is the Brno City Transport Company (DPmB), which also operates a mostly recreational ferry route at the Brno Dam Lake. A tourist minibus provides a brief tour of the city. In 2011, the city announced plans to build a metro system light rail system to alleviate overcrowding of trams and to reduce congestion on the surface.\" brief='Brno has a rich history in cycling, with multiple world championships hosted and a long tradition of horse-drawn tram operations. The city also boasts a diverse range of sports teams and a comprehensive public transport network.'\n"

There are basically no limits for the coverage of the medical expenses and the insurance company cannot cancel your insurance or refuse to extend it if you fulfill required conditions.

The monthly premium could be less than with the public insurance, but the coverage has lower limits at the same time.

In order to buy a transferable public transport ticket you need to create a registration on eshop of BrnoID.cz (using just an e-mail adress and setting up your password). In order to buy it, just click on \"Buy a ticket\" button on the left side of the eshop. First you need to add a ticket carrier by using button \"Add a new ticket carrier\" and then select him with \"Select a carrier\". Next step is selecting a ticket itself and when you’re done, confirm it with \"Select\" button. As the last step you have to select a date and time when the validity of the ticket should start. You can select any date including the day when you are buying it, up to 30 days in advance. This step is confirmed using \"Add to cart button\" and then you have to confirm the whole selection with \"Proceed to checkout\" button. Now you can select the method of payment. You can select either the option of paying using GoPay that enables you to pay using internet banking of some banks, or you can pay via bank card online. If you don’t want to use this method, you can select the second one, but only if your transportation card begins its validity in 5 or more working days. This method is called Pay via OFFLINE bank transfer. If you’ll select GoPay, your payment will only need to be confirmed – you don’t need to fill anything in it.

They have a long tradition and a unique place in Czech culture. But what do these terms mean today? Faced with one crisis after another – social, ecological and geopolitical – does it still make sense to develop glass and porcelain into the future? We believe it does, and we are convinced that the disclaimer “Made in Czechia“ has a bright future ahead, both with standard factories as well as small art studios. All 50+ original works featured as part of the exhibition have a common origin – their glass, porcelain and ceramics were made in the fires of Czech furnaces and kilns. We selected pieces from prestigious glass producers and exporters, the foremost porcelain works, the major players on the design scene, as well as the up-and-coming generation of designers whose work it pays to follow. The exhibition will take you through four thematic sections: Industry → , Adaptation → , Identity → and Experiment → . You will encounter works which test the limits of applied art and deal with contemporary social problems, such as industry competitiveness, its environmental impact, the use of classical forms, and the implementation of new technologies.' brief='The Made by Fire exhibition is a commemorative event that celebrates the 150th anniversary of The Museum of Applied Arts of The Moravian Gallery in Brno.

Perhaps you wouldn´t expect this genre from a composer of famous tragic operas, but there you would be wrong, as in actual fact Verdi wanted to write a comedy all his life, but only got round to it with his last opera. And so a masterpiece inspired by the famous Shakespearean figure, Sir John Falstaff, was created. Falstaff, a resident of the Garter Inn, enjoys partaking of good food and drink, but is particularly interested in the local Windsor ladies Alice Ford and Meg Page. The fact that they are both married doesn´t bother him at all; on the contrary, it only adds spice to his desires. Meg and Alice don´t care for his affections, and, with the help of Mistress Quicky, entangle him in their webs and teach him a proper lesson. However, Falstaff concludes this bittersweet comedy with the wise words: “The whole world is a farce.” Verdi, who had experienced a lot himself and knew how to enjoy life, left the world a comic opera that is hard to match. Smart and witty, with occasional subtle parodies of Verdi´s typical heroic performances, full of ensemble numbers which are clearly inspired by Rossini, and with humour overflowing with understanding for all that is human, such is his Falstaff that is returning to the Brno stage after fifty years away.' brief='A comedy opera by Giuseppe Verdi, based on Sir John Falstaff’s story.

Thanks to autoteatro, you might experience for a while what it felt like to be in their skin, and you will be able to imagine what they had to go through.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat is Autoteatro? Autoteatro is a specific form of theater that engages participants in an immersive and interactive experience. In Autoteatro, individuals become both the actors and the audience, blurring the traditional boundaries between performer and spectator. Audience is entering the skin of protagonists of the play, becoming its main characters.\\r\\n\\r\\nAutoteatro takes place directly in a café during regular opening hours. Participants receive headphones through which they receive all the instructions. The experience is also guided by specially trained actors who enhance the overall atmosphere of the play.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout the play Troublesome Classmates In the play Troublesome Classmates, you will immerse in the lives of two contemporaries of the communist revolution in Czechoslovakia – Jana Kaněrová and Zdeněk Adamec. They experienced the times of World War II, collectivization, and time of fabricated political trials. How do they remember that era? What was it like growing up in a time when one had to be a communist or face repressions that could cost one’s life?\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth Kaněrová and Adamec shared their memories with the Institute of National Memory. Students from JAMU (Janáček Academy of Performing Arts), under the guidance of Monika Okurková, transformed these memories into immersive theater for two spectators.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor each performance, we expect 2 participants, a man and a woman. They will sit at a table in a café (or a similar space), wearing headphones that will allow them to immerse in the story and take on the roles of Jana Kaněrová or Zdeněk Adamec, experiencing at least partially what they went through years ago.

An incredibly sophisticated systems of backdrops and drapes enriches the spectators’ visual delight. The peculiar owner of an inn in Florence, as we know her from Carlo Goldoni’s comedy, is a very competent woman who is more versed in business than anybody else. Both the pub and the rooms are always full and many clients long to win her affection. Some of them let it show rather ostentatiously, such as the impoverished yet boastful Marquis Di Forlipopoli and the upstart, self-centred Earl d’Albafiorit. Even though serving such importunate admirers might seem amusing, the lively innkeeper finds their obtuseness gruelling. Being a jovial person, she sits up and takes notice when baron Di Ripafratta – a sworn adversary of women – walks into her pub. Mirandolina is closely bound to the starring actress Tereza Groszmannová, whose translation of the play is custom-made both for herself and her fellow actors. The characters express themselves with a well-timed vigour, allowing dynamic acting. The highly pertinent and jaunty language of the script plays skilfully with ambiguities.' brief=\"The play 'Mirandolina' presents a dynamic commedia dell´arte experience with vivacious acting, astonishing numbers, and sophisticated backdrops.

The family house, which used to be attended by renowned guests, now attracts merely eccentrics and outsiders. Soon, their brother dissipates the bequest and the necessity of earning their living makes them loose what aristocrats took for granted: free time. Their desire to live a happy and fuller life, their longing for love and for a new home leads the sisters into extreme situations. Bitter laughter, laughable tears – what seems to be ordinary fortunes of common people unlocks great stories of love and adversity.

At first glance, her work impresses with its concentration, sense of rhythm, cyclicality and temporality. To a certain extent, it is also characterised by a certain austerity, or even asceticism. The orderliness with which he completes cycles, sets and volumes of drawings, watercolours and prints, as well as his reliance on lapidary means of expression, is probably related to his deep experience with writing, typography and calligraphy. The generational experience of the artist, who studied free and applied graphics, design and book culture at the Academy of Arts and Crafts in Prague at the turn of the 19...0s and 19...0s, and then settled permanently in Brno, where she began her independent creative career, is also undeniable.' brief='Marie Filippovová represents a prominent figure on the Brno art scene with characteristic concentration and rhythm.

One of the best known is the Legend of the Brno Dragon. According to this legend, a terrible creature was terrorizing the citizens of Brno. The people had never seen this animal before, so they called it a dragon. They lived in fear of the dragon until one citizen managed to kill the monster by tricking it into eating a carcass filled with lime. In reality the dragon was a crocodile, the preserved body of which is now displayed at the entrance of the Old Town Hall. Crocodile and dragon motifs are common in Brno. A crocodile (Czech: krokodýl) is the local stuffed baguette, and the city radio station is known as Radio Krokodýl. The local baseball team is named Draci Brno (English: Brno Dragons) and the local rugby club is named RC Dragon Brno. There is also a local American football team called the Brno Alligators. An Intercity train connecting Brno and Prague is called Brněnský drak (English: The Brno dragon). Next to the \\\\\"dragon\\\\\" at the Old Town Hall is the town\\'s second well-known emblem, a wagon wheel made from a tree found and cut down 50 miles from the city. According to the legend, a local man made a wager that he could fell the tree, make a wheel out of it, and roll the wheel to the City of Brno, all within a single day. Since the achievement was deemed to be impossible by normal human means, the man was believed to have called on the devil for assistance, and died in poverty as a result. Another local legend relates to the siege of the city by Swedish forces in 1645. The locals and the Swedish army were in a stalemate, and the Swedish general declared that he would withdraw if his army had not won by noon. The bell ringer at Petrov Cathedral tricked him by ringing the bell an hour early, and keeping his word, the general and his army left. As a historic tribute to the event, the bell at Petrov Cathedral still rings for noon an hour earlier, at 11 o\\'clock. At this time, the Brno astronomical clock also releases a glass ball as a souvenir.\",\"brief\":\"Information about the local legends of Brno, including the Legend of the Brno Dragon and other significant stories related to the city\\'s history and culture.\"}', name='add_static'), tool_calls=None))], created=1714334017, model='gpt-3.5-turbo-0125', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint='fp_3b956da36b', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=524, prompt_tokens=1342, total_tokens=1866))\n"

Also, based on the income from the previous year, you will be informed by your accountant of the new monthly health care contribution for the current year. The amount is determined by the profit achieved in the previous year. The assessment base for calculation of health insurance is 50% of the profit (gross income minus expenses equals profit). The health care contribution is 13.5% of the assessment base. In most cases – where the lump sum for expenses is 60% – this effectively amounts to about 2.7% of the income. If the actual assessment base is lower than the minimum calculation basis, then the health care contribution is set at the minimum monthly advance mentioned above.

Brno was first mentioned in Cosmas\\' Chronica Boemorum dated to the year 1091, when Bohemian king Vratislaus II besieged his brother Conrad at Brno castle. In the mid 11th century, Moravia was divided into three separate territories; each had its own ruler, coming from the Přemyslids dynasty, but independent of the other two, and subordinate only to the Bohemian ruler in Prague. The seats of these rulers and thus the \\\\\"capitals\\\\\" of these territories were the castles and towns of Brno, Olomouc, and Znojmo. In the late 12th century, Moravia began to reunify, forming the Margraviate of Moravia. From then until the mid of the 17th century, it was not clear which town should be the capital of Moravia. Political power was divided between Brno and Olomouc, but Znojmo also played an important role. The Moravian Diet, the Moravian Land Tables, and the Moravian Land Court were all seated in both cities at once. However, Brno was the official seat of the Moravian Margraves (rulers of Moravia), and later its geographical position closer to Vienna also became important. Otherwise, until 1642 Olomouc had a larger population than Brno, and was the seat of the only Roman Catholic diocese in Moravia. In 1243 Brno was granted the large and small city privileges by the King, and was thus recognized as a royal city. As throughout Eastern Central Europe, the granting of city privileges was connected with immigration from German-speaking lands. In 1324 Queen Elisabeth Richeza of Poland founded the Basilica of the Assumption of Our Lady, which now houses her grave. In the 14th century, Brno became one of the centres for the Moravian regional assemblies, whose meetings alternated between Brno and Olomouc. These assemblies made political, legal, and financial decisions. Brno and Olomouc were also the seats of the Land Court and the Moravian Land Tables, thus they were the two most important cities in Moravia. From the mid 14th century to the early 15th century, Špilberk Castle had served as the permanent seat of the Margraves of Moravia; one of them was elected the King of the Romans. Brno was besieged in 1428 and again in 1430 by the Hussites during the Hussite Wars. Both attempts to conquer the city failed.\",\"brief\":\"Brno, established in the early 11th century, has been a significant historical center in Moravia, Czech Republic.

Autoteatro is a specific form of theater that engages participants in an immersive and interactive experience. In Autoteatro, individuals become both the actors and the audience, blurring the traditional boundaries between performer and spectator. Audience is entering the skin of protagonists of the play, becoming its main characters.\\\\nAutoteatro takes place directly in a café during regular opening hours. Participants receive headphones through which they receive all the instructions. The experience is also guided by specially trained actors who enhance the overall atmosphere of the play.\\\\nAbout the play Troublesome Classmates In the play Troublesome Classmates, you will immerse in the lives of two contemporaries of the communist revolution in Czechoslovakia – Jana Kaněrová and Zdeněk Adamec. They experienced the times of World War II, collectivization, and time of fabricated political trials. How do they remember that era? What was it like growing up in a time when one had to be a communist or face repressions that could cost one’s life?\\\\nBoth Kaněrová and Adamec shared their memories with the Institute of National Memory. Students from JAMU (Janáček Academy of Performing Arts), under the guidance of Monika Okurková, transformed these memories into immersive theater for two spectators.\\\\nFor each performance, we expect 2 participants, a man and a woman. They will sit at a table in a café (or a similar space), wearing headphones that will allow them to immerse in the story and take on the roles of Jana Kaněrová or Zdeněk Adamec, experiencing at least partially what they went through years ago.
