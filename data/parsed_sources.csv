""text"": ""In the 17th century, amidst the backdrop of the Thirty Years' War, significant historical events shaped Brno's trajectory. In 1641, Emperor Ferdinand III, also the Margrave of Moravia, made a pivotal decision: relocating the diet, court, and land tables from Olomouc to Brno. This move was prompted by Olomouc's vulnerability to Swedish invasions due to the presence of Collegium Nordicum. Consequently, in 1642, Olomouc fell to the Swedish Army, which occupied it for eight years. Meanwhile, under the leadership of Jean-Louis Raduit de Souches, Brno emerged as a bastion of resistance against Swedish forces led by General Lennart Torstenson. Brno's successful defense earned it the distinction of being the sole capital of the Margraviate of Moravia, a status affirmed after the Thirty Years' War ended in 1648. This designation was later reaffirmed by Emperor Joseph II in 1782 and by the Moravian constitution in 1849. Today, the Moravian Land Tables, once housed in Brno, are preserved in the Moravian Regional Archive, adding to the rich cultural heritage of the Czech Republic. Meanwhile, Špilberk Castle underwent a significant transformation during this period, being rebuilt as an imposing Baroque citadel. In 1742, Brno faced another challenge when the Prussian Army, led by Frederick the Great, besieged the city, although the siege ultimately failed. Additionally, in 1777, the Catholic Church established the bishopric of Brno, with Mathias Franz Graf von Chorinsky Freiherr von Ledske becoming its inaugural bishop. These events collectively reflect the resilience and evolution of Brno during the tumultuous 17th century."",

""text"": ""In the 20th century, Brno underwent significant transformations, both in its demographics and its administrative structure. Around 1900, Brno had a predominantly German-speaking population of 63%, with Czech-speaking residents primarily in the suburbs. This bilingual environment fostered a mixed idiom known as 'Brünnerisch.' After World War I in 1919, Brno expanded with the annexation of neighboring towns and municipalities, forming Greater Brno (Velké Brno). This move aimed to balance the German-speaking majority with Czech communities, altering the city's demographics. By 1921, Brno became the capital of the Land of Moravia, and later, the Land of Moravia-Silesia in 1928. During the German occupation from 1939 to 1945, Brno faced severe repression, with universities closed, and atrocities committed by the Gestapo. The city also witnessed deportations of Jews to concentration camps and suffered Allied bombardment campaigns. After the war, ethnic German residents were expelled, and Moravian autonomy was abolished following the 1948 Czechoslovak coup d'état. Brno then became the administrative center of the South Moravian Region. The 1960s and 1970s saw the construction of large panel housing estates, while during the communist era, industry dominated the workforce.

""brief"": ""Brno is steeped in local legends, including the story of the Brno Dragon, actually a crocodile, defeated by a clever citizen. The city's emblematic crocodile motif extends to local culture, with culinary and sports references. Another tale involves a wager with the devil to roll a wagon wheel to Brno within a day, commemorated alongside the legend of outsmarting Swedish forces besieging the city."",
""text"": ""There are several legends connected with the City of Brno. One of the best known is the Legend of the Brno Dragon. According to this legend, a terrible creature was terrorizing the citizens of Brno. The people had never seen this animal before, so they called it a dragon. They lived in fear of the dragon until one citizen managed to kill the monster by tricking it into eating a carcass filled with lime. In reality the dragon was a crocodile, the preserved body of which is now displayed at the entrance of the Old Town Hall. Crocodile and dragon motifs are common in Brno. A crocodile (Czech: krokodýl) is the local stuffed baguette, and the city radio station is known as Radio Krokodýl. The local baseball team is named Draci Brno (English: Brno Dragons) and the local rugby club is named RC Dragon Brno. There is also a local American football team called the Brno Alligators. An Intercity train connecting Brno and Prague is called Brněnský drak (English: The Brno dragon). Next to the 'dragon' at the Old Town Hall is the town's second well-known emblem, a wagon wheel made from a tree found and cut down 50 miles from the city. According to the legend, a local man made a wager that he could fell the tree, make a wheel out of it, and roll the wheel to the City of Brno, all within a single day. Since the achievement was deemed to be impossible by normal human means, the man was believed to have called on the devil for assistance, and died in poverty as a result. Another local legend relates to the siege of the city by Swedish forces in 1645. The locals and the Swedish army were in a stalemate, and the Swedish general declared that he would withdraw if his army had not won by noon. The bell ringer at Petrov Cathedral tricked him by ringing the bell an hour early, and keeping his word, the general and his army left. As a historic tribute to the event, the bell at Petrov Cathedral still rings for noon an hour earlier, at 11 o'clock. At this time, the Brno astronomical clock also releases a glass ball as a souvenir."",

""text"": ""Historically, the Brno basin has been inhabited since prehistoric times, with its direct predecessor being a fortified settlement of the Great Moravian Empire known as Staré Zámky. Established as a castle in the early 11th century by a non-ruling prince from the House of Přemyslid, Brno became one of Moravia's key centers alongside Olomouc and Znojmo. The city was first mentioned in Cosmas' Chronica Boemorum in 1091 when Bohemian king Vratislaus II besieged his brother Conrad at Brno castle. During the mid-11th century, Moravia was divided into three separate territories, each with its ruler from the Přemyslid dynasty. However, Brno emerged as an influential seat of power, officially becoming the seat of the Moravian Margraves and gaining importance due to its proximity to Vienna. Despite Olomouc's larger population and status as the seat of the only Roman Catholic diocese in Moravia until 1642, Brno's significance in Moravian politics and administration remained substantial."",

In 1324, Queen Elisabeth Richeza of Poland founded the Basilica of the Assumption of Our Lady, which now serves as her final resting place. During the 14th century, Brno emerged as a key center for Moravian regional assemblies, which convened alternately between Brno and Olomouc. These assemblies played a crucial role in making political, legal, and financial decisions. Brno and Olomouc also hosted the Land Court and the Moravian Land Tables, cementing their status as the most significant cities in Moravia. From the mid-14th century to the early 15th century, Špilberk Castle served as the permanent seat of the Margraves of Moravia, with one of them even being elected as the King of the Romans.

""text"": ""Brno has a long theatre tradition. Brno has the oldest theatre building in Central Europe, the Reduta Theatre on Zelný trh. The first theatre plays in Brno probably took place in the City Tavern, today's Reduta Theatre; however, the first theatre with boxes was built in this complex in 1733. The first documented professional Czech performance took place in 1767, again in the Reduta Theatre; the play was called Zamilovaný ponocný (English: Watchman in Love) and was performed by the Venice Theatre Company. The same year, Mozart performed in the theatre with his elder sister Anna Maria (Nannerl). In that year the Mozart family spent Christmas in Brno, and their visit is commemorated by a statue of Mozart as a child in front of the Reduta Theatre. The theatre's Mozart Hall was also named after him. The Národní divadlo v Brně (English: National Theatre of Brno; NdB) is the leading producer of opera, drama, and ballet in the city of Brno. The first permanent seat of NdB was established in 1884, and today this institution owns the Mahen Theatre, built in 1882, Janáček Theatre, built in 1965, and the Reduta Theatre. The composer Leoš Janáček is also connected with the National Theatre of Brno. The Mahen Theatre was the first theatre building in Europe to be illuminated by Thomas Edison's electric light bulbs; at that time it was a completely new invention and there were no power plants built in the city, so a small steam power plant was built nearby just to power the theatre, and Edison came to Brno in 1911 to see it. The most commercially successful theatre in Brno is the Brno City Theatre, founded in 1945; its performances are usually sold out. They also stage about 150 performances abroad every year. The theatre's repertoire consists primarily of musical and dramatic shows. There are a variety of smaller theatres in Brno, including the Bolek Polivka Theatre, the Goose on a String Theatre (\""Divadlo Husa na provázku\""), HaDivadlo, Radost Puppet Theatre (\""loutkové divadlo Radost\""), and Polárka Theatre. The Mahen Theatre was originally called the City Theatre, and until 1918 it performed exclusively in German and was not part of the National Theatre of Brno. Between 1971 and 1978, some plays were performed at the Brno Exhibition Centre due to reconstruction of the Mahen Theatre."",""

Construction of a large city ring road (road I/42) is underway, complemented by road tunnels at Pisarky, Husovice, Hlinky, and Královo pole. Air transport is facilitated by two functional airports: Brno–Tuřany Airport, which experienced increased passenger traffic until 2011 but faced declines, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, and Medlánky Airport, primarily serving recreational flying activities. Cycling is popular in Brno due to its flat terrain, with approximately 38 kilometers of existing cycling and roller skating tracks in 2011, continually expanding. A long bikeway stretching to Vienna spans approximately 130 kilometers.
