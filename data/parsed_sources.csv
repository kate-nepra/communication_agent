""text"": ""In the 17th century, amidst the backdrop of the Thirty Years' War, significant historical events shaped Brno's trajectory. In 1641, Emperor Ferdinand III, also the Margrave of Moravia, made a pivotal decision: relocating the diet, court, and land tables from Olomouc to Brno. This move was prompted by Olomouc's vulnerability to Swedish invasions due to the presence of Collegium Nordicum. Consequently, in 1642, Olomouc fell to the Swedish Army, which occupied it for eight years. Meanwhile, under the leadership of Jean-Louis Raduit de Souches, Brno emerged as a bastion of resistance against Swedish forces led by General Lennart Torstenson. Brno's successful defense earned it the distinction of being the sole capital of the Margraviate of Moravia, a status affirmed after the Thirty Years' War ended in 1648. This designation was later reaffirmed by Emperor Joseph II in 1782 and by the Moravian constitution in 1849. Today, the Moravian Land Tables, once housed in Brno, are preserved in the Moravian Regional Archive, adding to the rich cultural heritage of the Czech Republic. Meanwhile, Špilberk Castle underwent a significant transformation during this period, being rebuilt as an imposing Baroque citadel. In 1742, Brno faced another challenge when the Prussian Army, led by Frederick the Great, besieged the city, although the siege ultimately failed. Additionally, in 1777, the Catholic Church established the bishopric of Brno, with Mathias Franz Graf von Chorinsky Freiherr von Ledske becoming its inaugural bishop.

""text"": ""In the 20th century, Brno underwent significant transformations, both in its demographics and its administrative structure. Around 1900, Brno had a predominantly German-speaking population of 63%, with Czech-speaking residents primarily in the suburbs.

After World War I in 1919, Brno expanded with the annexation of neighboring towns and municipalities, forming Greater Brno (Velké Brno). This move aimed to balance the German-speaking majority with Czech communities, altering the city's demographics. By 1921, Brno became the capital of the Land of Moravia, and later, the Land of Moravia-Silesia in 1928. During the German occupation from 1939 to 1945, Brno faced severe repression, with universities closed, and atrocities committed by the Gestapo. The city also witnessed deportations of Jews to concentration camps and suffered Allied bombardment campaigns. After the war, ethnic German residents were expelled, and Moravian autonomy was abolished following the 1948 Czechoslovak coup d'état.

The biggest festival in Brno is the fireworks competition festival, Ignis Brunensis (Latin for 'Flame of Brno'), held annually in June, part of the 'Brno – City in the Centre of Europe' festival. Ignis Brunensis is the biggest show of its kind in Central Europe, usually attracting 100,000–200,000 visitors to each display. The international film festival Cinema Mundi screens about 60 films competing for Oscar nomination in the category of Best Foreign Language Film. Theatre World Brno is another international festival held annually in the city, in which Brno theatres and the city centre stage around 100 performances by national and foreign ensembles. Other festivals held regularly in Brno include the International Music Festival Brno, the Spilberk International Music Festival, and the Summer Shakespeare Festival.

""brief"": ""Brno is steeped in local legends, including the story of the Brno Dragon, actually a crocodile, defeated by a clever citizen. The city's emblematic crocodile motif extends to local culture, with culinary and sports references. Another tale involves a wager with the devil to roll a wagon wheel to Brno within a day, commemorated alongside the legend of outsmarting Swedish forces besieging the city."",
""text"": ""There are several legends connected with the City of Brno. One of the best known is the Legend of the Brno Dragon. According to this legend, a terrible creature was terrorizing the citizens of Brno. The people had never seen this animal before, so they called it a dragon. They lived in fear of the dragon until one citizen managed to kill the monster by tricking it into eating a carcass filled with lime. In reality the dragon was a crocodile, the preserved body of which is now displayed at the entrance of the Old Town Hall. Crocodile and dragon motifs are common in Brno. A crocodile (Czech: krokodýl) is the local stuffed baguette, and the city radio station is known as Radio Krokodýl. The local baseball team is named Draci Brno (English: Brno Dragons) and the local rugby club is named RC Dragon Brno. There is also a local American football team called the Brno Alligators. An Intercity train connecting Brno and Prague is called Brněnský drak (English: The Brno dragon). Next to the 'dragon' at the Old Town Hall is the town's second well-known emblem, a wagon wheel made from a tree found and cut down 50 miles from the city. According to the legend, a local man made a wager that he could fell the tree, make a wheel out of it, and roll the wheel to the City of Brno, all within a single day. Since the achievement was deemed to be impossible by normal human means, the man was believed to have called on the devil for assistance, and died in poverty as a result. Another local legend relates to the siege of the city by Swedish forces in 1645. The locals and the Swedish army were in a stalemate, and the Swedish general declared that he would withdraw if his army had not won by noon. The bell ringer at Petrov Cathedral tricked him by ringing the bell an hour early, and keeping his word, the general and his army left. As a historic tribute to the event, the bell at Petrov Cathedral still rings for noon an hour earlier, at 11 o'clock. At this time, the Brno astronomical clock also releases a glass ball as a souvenir."",

Established as a castle in the early 11th century by a non-ruling prince from the House of Přemyslid, Brno became one of Moravia's key centers alongside Olomouc and Znojmo. The city was first mentioned in Cosmas' Chronica Boemorum in 1091 when Bohemian king Vratislaus II besieged his brother Conrad at Brno castle. During the mid-11th century, Moravia was divided into three separate territories, each with its ruler from the Přemyslid dynasty. However, Brno emerged as an influential seat of power, officially becoming the seat of the Moravian Margraves and gaining importance due to its proximity to Vienna. Despite Olomouc's larger population and status as the seat of the only Roman Catholic diocese in Moravia until 1642, Brno's significance in Moravian politics and administration remained substantial."",

During the 14th century, Brno emerged as a key center for Moravian regional assemblies, which convened alternately between Brno and Olomouc. These assemblies played a crucial role in making political, legal, and financial decisions. Brno and Olomouc also hosted the Land Court and the Moravian Land Tables, cementing their status as the most significant cities in Moravia. From the mid-14th century to the early 15th century, Špilberk Castle served as the permanent seat of the Margraves of Moravia, with one of them even being elected as the King of the Romans.

""text"": ""Brno has a long theatre tradition. Brno has the oldest theatre building in Central Europe, the Reduta Theatre on Zelný trh. The first theatre plays in Brno probably took place in the City Tavern, today's Reduta Theatre; however, the first theatre with boxes was built in this complex in 1733. The first documented professional Czech performance took place in 1767, again in the Reduta Theatre; the play was called Zamilovaný ponocný (English: Watchman in Love) and was performed by the Venice Theatre Company. The same year, Mozart performed in the theatre with his elder sister Anna Maria (Nannerl). In that year the Mozart family spent Christmas in Brno, and their visit is commemorated by a statue of Mozart as a child in front of the Reduta Theatre. The theatre's Mozart Hall was also named after him. The Národní divadlo v Brně (English: National Theatre of Brno; NdB) is the leading producer of opera, drama, and ballet in the city of Brno. The first permanent seat of NdB was established in 1884, and today this institution owns the Mahen Theatre, built in 1882, Janáček Theatre, built in 1965, and the Reduta Theatre. The composer Leoš Janáček is also connected with the National Theatre of Brno. The Mahen Theatre was the first theatre building in Europe to be illuminated by Thomas Edison's electric light bulbs; at that time it was a completely new invention and there were no power plants built in the city, so a small steam power plant was built nearby just to power the theatre, and Edison came to Brno in 1911 to see it. The most commercially successful theatre in Brno is the Brno City Theatre, founded in 1945; its performances are usually sold out. They also stage about 150 performances abroad every year. The theatre's repertoire consists primarily of musical and dramatic shows. There are a variety of smaller theatres in Brno, including the Bolek Polivka Theatre, the Goose on a String Theatre (\""Divadlo Husa na provázku\""), HaDivadlo, Radost Puppet Theatre (\""loutkové divadlo Radost\""), and Polárka Theatre. The Mahen Theatre was originally called the City Theatre, and until 1918 it performed exclusively in German and was not part of the National Theatre of Brno. Between 1971 and 1978, some plays were performed at the Brno Exhibition Centre due to reconstruction of the Mahen Theatre."",

The main railway station serves as a central hub for regional train services, catering to approximately 50,000 passengers daily. Brno is a significant international road transport crossroads, with motorways D1 and D2 leading to Ostrava and Prague, and Bratislava, respectively. The D52 motorway links Brno to Vienna, with the planned D43 motorway set to connect the city to northwestern Moravia. Construction of a large city ring road (road I/42) is underway, complemented by road tunnels at Pisarky, Husovice, Hlinky, and Královo pole. Air transport is facilitated by two functional airports: Brno–Tuřany Airport, which experienced increased passenger traffic until 2011 but faced declines, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, and Medlánky Airport, primarily serving recreational flying activities. Cycling is popular in Brno due to its flat terrain, with approximately 38 kilometers of existing cycling and roller skating tracks in 2011, continually expanding. A long bikeway stretching to Vienna spans approximately 130 kilometers.

The Church of St James in Brno was first mentioned in writing in 1228. Originally a Romanesque building, it was later replaced by a Gothic church. The construction on its three naves, in which builder Anton Pilgram participated, was interrupted by a fire in 1515. The church was repaired and completed in 1592. In the mid-18th century, its interior was modified in the Baroque style. Its Gothic look was restored in the 1870s when the main altar was created in its current form. The three naves, with their majestic pillars and lovely vaults, contain a number of tombstones of local citizens and prominent people related to the history of Brno, including Jean-Louis Raduit de Souches, the commander who successfully defended Brno during the Swedish siege of 1645. The church tower, completed in 1592, is one of the dominant features of Brno. It is 94 metres tall and features a surprising statue on the southern side: a small man showing his buttocks to passersby. The church was surrounded by a cemetery, which was closed due to the 1784 reforms by Emperor Joseph II. In 2001, an underground ossuary was discovered and is now open to the public."",

Autoteatro is a specific form of theater that engages participants in an immersive and interactive experience. In Autoteatro, individuals become both the actors and the audience, blurring the traditional boundaries between performer and spectator. Audience is entering the skin of protagonists of the play, becoming its main characters.\nAutoteatro takes place directly in a café during regular opening hours. Participants receive headphones through which they receive all the instructions. The experience is also guided by specially trained actors who enhance the overall atmosphere of the play.\nAbout the play Troublesome Classmates In the play Troublesome Classmates, you will immerse in the lives of two contemporaries of the communist revolution in Czechoslovakia – Jana Kaněrová and Zdeněk Adamec. They experienced the times of World War II, collectivization, and time of fabricated political trials. How do they remember that era? What was it like growing up in a time when one had to be a communist or face repressions that could cost one’s life?\nBoth Kaněrová and Adamec shared their memories with the Institute of National Memory. Students from JAMU (Janáček Academy of Performing Arts), under the guidance of Monika Okurková, transformed these memories into immersive theater for two spectators.\nFor each performance, we expect 2 participants, a man and a woman. They will sit at a table in a café (or a similar space), wearing headphones that will allow them to immerse in the story and take on the roles of Jana Kaněrová or Zdeněk Adamec, experiencing at least partially what they went through years ago.

This resulted in an Action Plan for the Integrated Transformation of the Husovice Quarter. To ensure the plan did not include unrealistic or unfinanciable tasks, City Hall representatives also met with experts in individual areas who assessed which activities could be implemented. Together, they set a timeframe for achieving defined goals.\r\n\r\nThe proposed Action Plan was approved by the Brno City Council. Now it is time to start implementing the planned activities. Some have already been realized - such as installing informational signs banning alcohol consumption on Republic Square, more frequent cleaning of public spaces, and utilizing the \""Meals for Schools\"" project (meals for socially disadvantaged children). Coordination of further implementations, such as barrier-free MHD stops or new stations for shared bicycles, will be overseen by a coordinator who should be appointed at the Brno-North District Office.\r\n\r\nIf this systematic approach to problem areas in Husovice proves successful, it can be expanded to other city districts threatened by social exclusion or other problems."", ""url"": ""https://brno2050.cz/mame-plan-jak-z-husovic-opet-udelat-lepsi-misto-pro-zivot/"", ""date_fetched"": ""2024-05-15"", ""address"": ""Brno, Czech Republic""}",1

Naopak sami mnohem víc hledáme možnosti, jak nějaké solární panel rovněž získat a umístit je pokud možno na střechy domů a ne do polí uprostřed ničeho. Takhle si vlastní solární elektrárnu buduje také Brno. Městská společnost SAKO Brno Solar začala na konci roku 2021 s instalací solárních panelů na budovách, které patří městu. V dalších letech má počet domů získávajících sluneční energii přibývat. Zpočátku chce Brno využít vlastní budovy, případně objekty městských částí a městských společností.

Celkem je potřeba přepojit 671 odběrných míst a vyměnit přibližně 60 kilometrů parovodů za horkovody. Díky tomu se sníží ztráty v distribuční síti a výměníkových stanicích a vznikne technologicky vyspělý a spolehlivý systém dodávky tepla pro Brno 21. století. Prospěje to i životnímu prostředí – každý nahrazený kilometr znamená o 336 tun oxidu uhličitého ročně méně. Zákazníkům (občanům Brna) přinese dodávka tepla za pomoci horké vody úsporu tepla ve výši 8–15 %, zhruba 1 500 – 2 000 Kč ročně na domácnost.\nProjekty\nUmění vyrobit si energii z čistých zdrojů, které jsou kolem nás\nVizí Brna je, že bude mít v budoucnu zabezpečenou dostatečnou energetickou kapacitu z čistých obnovitelných zdrojů energie a díky tomu také sníženou produkci látek škodlivých pro lidské zdraví a životní prostředí.

Znáte ovšem pojem Brněnská metropolitní oblast (BMO)? Ta vymezuje přirozené území 184 obcí rozléhajících se okolo Brna. BMO definují intenzivní denní vazby jako dojížďka a dostupnost, přičemž hranice oblasti se v čase mohou měnit. Jádrem oblasti každopádně dlouhodobě zůstává Brno jako centrum služeb, pracovních příležitostí nebo vzdělávání. Obyvatelé okolních obcí pak do Brna denně dojíždějí za prací či studiem. Brno je na těchto obcích závislé, stejně tak jsou ale obce okolo Brna závislé na svém centru. BMO se rychle vyvíjí, v současnosti ovšem stále schází legislativní rámec, který by oblast se 700 tisíci obyvateli zákonně definoval a usnadnil její rozvoj. Město Brno tak spolu s Masarykovou univerzitou a Technologickou agenturou ČR zkoumá motivaci obcí pro meziobecní spolupráci. Na základě výsledků zkoumání může v budoucnu dojít k právní úpravě, po níž by obce snadněji spolupracovali na společných projektech řešících dopravní obslužnost či péči o životní prostředí.\n\nMetropolitní rozvojová instituce\n\nZatímco v západní Evropě běžně zaštiťuje metropolitní rozvoj samostatná instituce, ve střední Evropě ještě podobný nástroj není standardem. Město Brno by se v tomto směru rádo stalo průkopníkem a vytvořilo metropolitní rozvojovou instituci, která by zkvalitnila strategické metropolitní plánování a řízení Brněnské metropolitní oblasti. Metropolitní rozvojová instituce by řešila různé investiční i neinvestiční záležitosti a rozvíjela a koordinovala spolupráci aktérů působících v BMO.

Přihlašování nových zájemců bylo 15. září 2022 ukončeno .\nJedním ze základních programových pilířů koaliční smlouvy pro Zastupitelstvo města Brna ve volebním období 2022-2026 je i závazek pokračovat v projektu městského družstevního bydlení . Rada města Brna na své R9/017. schůzi, konané dne 1.2.2023 přijala pod bodem 31 usnesení, že losováním pořadí nových žadatelů, přihlášených v období od 15.6.2022 do 15.9.2022 do projektu Družstevní bydlení pro mladé, dle jednotlivých lokalit, se pověřuje Ing. Karin Podivinská , 4. náměstkyně primátorky, a to po zajištění územních rozhodnutí pro jednotlivé lokality. U lokality Kamenný vrch II je k dispozici územní rozhodnutí pro první část projektu, toto územní rozhodnutí nabylo právní moci dne 29.4.2023. Losování pořadí nových žadatelů k této lokalitě proběhlo dne 24.10.2023.\nInformace k ostatním lokalitám družstevního bydlení naleznete pod odkazem „Přehled lokalit“ níže.\nPřihlášení žadatelé, kteří městu podali vyplněné přihlašovací či rekapitulační formuláře a splnění kritérií projektu pouze deklarovali čestným prohlášením, budou splnění všech kritérií prokazovat družstvu, a to před podpisem rezervačních smluv s tím, že kritérium věku zůstane zachováno k datu podání přihlášky.\nJak funguje družstevní bydlení\nMěsto spolu se dvěma společnostmi vlastněnými městem založí družstvo a jako svůj vklad použije projektovou dokumentaci pro výstavbu. Rovněž město zřídí pro družstvo právo stavby ve smyslu občanského zákoníku k městským pozemkům určeným k výstavbě. Družstvo si následně vezme úvěr u banky, vybere zhotovitele a nechá postavit bytové domy. Po kolaudaci budov budou do družstva vstupovat členové – fyzické osoby, které vloží do družstva členský vklad dle požadavků úvěrující banky v předpokládané výši 10–15 % nákladové ceny bytu. Družstevníci budou byt užívat a platit družstvu nájemné, ze kterého družstvo bude splácet úvěr bance. Předpokládaná doba splácení úvěru je minimálně 30 let. Družstevníci budou splácet uvedenou cenu bytu navýšenou o DPH . Dle aktuální právní úpravy se nyní přičítá ke stavebním nákladům ( které tvoří cca 80-90 % ceny bytu) DPH ve snížené sazbě 12 %, k ostatním nákladům DPH v základní sazbě 21%.\nVýhody družstevního bydlení"", ""url"": ""https://bydleni.brno.cz/druzstevni-bydleni/"", ""date_fetched"": ""2024-05-15"", ""address"": ""Brno""}",1

Otevírat se bude v srpnu - Tiskový servis\nNa pevných základech v areálu Kociánky už stojí Dům pro Julii – jeden z prvních hospiců pro děti a mládež u nás. Svoji fyzickou tvář už získal a nyní čeká na první příběhy, které do něj zapíší klienti. To by se mělo stát už v srpnu letošního roku.\nDětská paliativní péče se věnuje nevyléčitelně nemocným dětem a mládeži od samotného stanovení diagnózy, čímž se významně liší od paliativy dospělých. Její potřeba se tak nepočítá na dny či měsíce, ale na roky. Roky, během nichž se o nemocné děti starají rodiče, často bez jakékoli institucionální pomoci, protože ta tady buď nebyla, nebo nemocnice či stacionáře nevyhovovaly a neměly kapacity. Přesně na tyto rodiny cílí Dům pro Julii.\nStavba začala v srpnu roku 2022 a zkolaudováno bude během června letošního roku. Z původně plánovaných 15 měsíců prací se stalo 20,5 měsíce, protože stavbaře překvapilo hned několik nepříjemností. První byl nález skládky, která se musela odborně zlikvidovat, a následně se zjistilo nestabilní podloží jak v prostorách stavby, tak ve venkovních pojízdných plochách. Nevhodné podloží muselo tedy být vytěženo a nahrazeno únosným materiálem. Aktuálně probíhají poslední práce hlavně venku – dokončuje se komunikace, parkoviště a sadové úpravy. Vevnitř se dokončují poslední detaily, aby bylo vše připraveno na předání stavby.\nCelkové náklady na stavbu, která byla v režii města Brna, dosáhly na 184,5 milionu korun bez DPH. Městu se povedlo získat na projekt dotaci z evropských fondů v hodnotě 86 milionů korun, zbytek zaplatilo ze svého rozpočtu. Následně budovu předá neziskové organizaci Domov pro Julii. Ta bude hospic provozovat.\nTřípatrová budova s vnitřním atriem se nachází v klidné lokalitě zahrady domova pro seniory na Kociánce. Díky architektonickému návrhu ateliéru Čtyřstěn naprosto zapadla do okolí, a to i využitím okolního svahu, do něhož dům vrostl a pomocí pobytové střechy můžete sejít z procházky po okolí rovnou dovnitř domu. Dům pro Julii má celkem 10 pokojů pro klienty, z nichž osm je určeno pro pobytovou odlehčovací službu. Ta vypadá tak, že děti zůstanou v hospici kratší dobu a rodiče si budou moci odpočinout. Dva pokoje budou fungovat jako hospicová lůžka pro klienty v terminálním stádiu onemocnění. Součástí jsou oddělené ubytovací kapacity pro rodiče a sourozence a byt posledního rozloučení."", ""url"": ""https://cosedeje.brno.cz/w/mesto-dokoncuje-dum-pro-julii-otevirat-se-bude-v-srpnu"", ""date_fetched"": ""2024-05-15"", ""address"": ""Kociánky, Brno""}",1

Zároveň se po architektech vyžadovalo, aby představili rekonstrukci jedné ze správních budov na administrativní zázemí, podobu obchodních ploch pro květinářství a kamenictví a jejich umístění a podobu provozních budov podél ohradní zdi.

We met with these actors five times in workshops directly in the locality and gradually identified the main problems, set boundaries for the solved area (part of Husovice), designed goals leading to problem elimination, and specific activities that will ultimately lead to improved living conditions in the area; 4. From the workshop results, we gradually created an Analytical and then a Conceptual part of the Integrated Plan for Transforming the Husovice Locality, which will be followed by an Action Plan. Each document is approved step-by-step by the Brno City Council.\nThe four main problem areas we defined are: 1. Safety 2. Housing 3. Human Factor 4.

Národní divadlo toho využije pro opravu fasády Mahenova divadla.\nZelené střechy v Brně rostou díky městu jako houby po dešti. Celkem jich bylo realizováno 302, o čemž se můžete přesvědčit v mapovém portálu na webu ekodotace.brno.cz.

The people had never seen this animal before, so they called it a dragon. They lived in fear of the dragon until one citizen managed to kill the monster by tricking it into eating a carcass filled with lime. In reality the dragon was a crocodile, the preserved body of which is now displayed at the entrance of the Old Town Hall. Crocodile and dragon motifs are common in Brno. A crocodile (Czech: krokodýl) is the local stuffed baguette, and the city radio station is known as Radio Krokodýl. The local baseball team is named Draci Brno (English: Brno Dragons) and the local rugby club is named RC Dragon Brno. There is also a local American football team called the Brno Alligators.

Next to the \""dragon\"" at the Old Town Hall is the town's second well-known emblem, a wagon wheel made from a tree found and cut down 50 miles from the city. According to the legend, a local man made a wager that he could fell the tree, make a wheel out of it, and roll the wheel to the City of Brno, all within a single day. Since the achievement was deemed to be impossible by normal human means, the man was believed to have called on the devil for assistance, and died in poverty as a result. Another local legend relates to the siege of the city by Swedish forces in 1645. The locals and the Swedish army were in a stalemate, and the Swedish general declared that he would withdraw if his army had not won by noon. The bell ringer at Petrov Cathedral tricked him by ringing the bell an hour early, and keeping his word, the general and his army left.

The city is a member of the UNESCO Creative Cities Network and was designated a \""City of Music\"" in 2017.\nHistory\n[edit]\nThe Brno basin has been inhabited since prehistoric times, but the town's direct predecessor was a fortified settlement of the Great Moravian Empire known as Staré Zámky, which was inhabited from the Neolithic Age until the early 11th century.\nIn the early 11th century Brno was established as a castle of a non-ruling prince from the House of Přemyslid, and Brno became one of the centres of Moravia along with Olomouc and Znojmo. Brno was first mentioned in Cosmas' Chronica Boemorum dated to the year 1091, when Bohemian king Vratislaus II besieged his brother Conrad at Brno castle.\nIn the mid 11th century, Moravia was divided into three separate territories; each had its own ruler, coming from the Přemyslids dynasty, but independent of the other two, and subordinate only to the Bohemian ruler in Prague. The seats of these rulers and thus the \""capitals\"" of these territories were the castles and towns of Brno, Olomouc, and Znojmo. In the late 12th century, Moravia began to reunify, forming the Margraviate of Moravia. From then until the mid of the 17th century, it was not clear which town should be the capital of Moravia. Political power was divided between Brno and Olomouc, but Znojmo also played an important role. The Moravian Diet, the Moravian Land Tables, and the Moravian Land Court were all seated in both cities at once.\nHowever, Brno was the official seat of the Moravian Margraves (rulers of Moravia), and later its geographical position closer to Vienna also became important. Otherwise, until 1642 Olomouc had a larger population than Brno, and was the seat of the only Roman Catholic diocese in Moravia."", ""url"": ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brno"", ""date_fetched"": ""2024-05-16"", ""address"": ""Brno, Czech Republic""}",1

In the 14th century, Brno became one of the centres for the Moravian regional assemblies, whose meetings alternated between Brno and Olomouc. These assemblies made political, legal, and financial decisions. Brno and Olomouc were also the seats of the Land Court and the Moravian Land Tables, thus they were the two most important cities in Moravia. From the mid 14th century to the early 15th century, Špilberk Castle had served as the permanent seat of the Margraves of Moravia; one of them was elected the King of the Romans.

Life in the city was therefore bilingual, and what was called in German 'Brünnerisch' was a mixed idiom containing elements from both languages. In 1919, after World War I, two neighbouring towns, Královo Pole and Husovice, and 21 other municipalities were annexed to Brno, creating Greater Brno (Czech: Velké Brno). This was done to dilute the German-speaking majority of close to 55,000 by the addition of the Czech communities of the city's neighborhood. Included in the German-speaking group were almost all of the 12,000 Jewish inhabitants, including several of the city's better known personalities, who made a substantial contribution to the city's cultural life. Greater Brno was almost seven times larger, with a population of about 222,000 – before that Brno had about 130,000 inhabitants. In 1921 Brno became the capital of the Land of Moravia (Czech: země Moravská ). Seven years later, Brno became the capital of the Land of Moravia-Silesia (Czech: země Moravskoslezská ). In 1930, 200,000 inhabitants declared themselves to be of Czech, and some 52,000 of German nationality, in both cases including the respective Jewish citizens. During the German occupation of the Czech lands between 1939 and 1945, all Czech universities were closed by the Nazis, including those in Brno. The Faculty of Law became the headquarters of the Gestapo, and the university hall of residence was used as a prison. About 35,000 Czechs and some American and British prisoners of war were imprisoned and tortured there; about 800 civilians were executed or died. Executions were public. The Nazis also operated a subcamp of the Auschwitz concentration camp, which held mostly Polish prisoners, an internment camp for Romani people in the city, and a forced labour 'education' camp in the present-day district of Dvorska."", ""url"": ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brno"", ""date_fetched"": ""2024-05-16"", ""address"": ""Brno, Czech Republic""}",1

After Terezín, many of them were sent to Auschwitz concentration camp, Minsk Ghetto, Rejowiec and other ghettos and concentration camps. Although Terezín was not an extermination camp, 995 people transported from Brno died there. Only 1,033 people returned after the war. Industrial facilities such as the Československá zbrojovka arms factory and the Zweigwerk aircraft engine factory (which became Zbrojovka's subsidiary Zetor after the war) and the city centre were targeted by several Allied bombardment campaigns between 1944 and 1945. The air strikes and later artillery fire killed some 1,200 people and destroyed 1,278 buildings. After the city's occupation by the Red Army on 26 April 1945 and the end of the war, ethnic German residents were expelled. In the Brno death march, beginning on 31 May 1945, about 27,000 German inhabitants of Brno were marched 64 kilometres (40 miles) to the Austrian border. According to testimony collected by German sources, about 5,200 of them died during the march. Later estimates by Czech sources put the death toll at about 1,700, with most deaths due to an epidemic of shigellosis. After the reestablishment of an independent Czechoslovak state after World War II, Prime Minister Edvard Beneš delivered a speech in Brno demanding the expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia. Shortly afterwards, 20,000 ethnic Germans from the city were expelled into Allied-occupied Austria. After the 1948 Czechoslovak coup d'état, the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic abolished Moravian autonomy and Brno thus ceased to be the capital of Moravia. Since then Moravia has been divided into administrative regions, with Brno the administrative centre of the South Moravian Region. In 1960s and 1970s, large panel housing estates were built in border districts, such as Bohunice, Líšeň, Bystrc and Vinohrady. During the communist era, most of the workforce was employed in industry, mainly machinery.

The first documented professional Czech performance took place in 1767, again in the Reduta Theatre; the play was called Zamilovaný ponocný (English: Watchman in Love) and was performed by the Venice Theatre Company. The same year, Mozart performed in the theatre with his elder sister Anna Maria (Nannerl). In that year the Mozart family spent Christmas in Brno, and their visit is commemorated by a statue of Mozart as a child in front of the Reduta Theatre. The theatre's Mozart Hall was also named after him. The Národní divadlo v Brně (English: National Theatre of Brno; NdB) is the leading producer of opera, drama, and ballet in the city of Brno. The first permanent seat of NdB was established in 1884, and today this institution owns the Mahen Theatre, built in 1882, Janáček Theatre, built in 1965, and the Reduta Theatre. The composer Leoš Janáček is also connected with the National Theatre of Brno. The Mahen Theatre was the first theatre building in Europe to be illuminated by Thomas Edison's electric light bulbs; at that time it was a completely new invention and there were no power plants built in the city, so a small steam power plant was built nearby just to power the theatre, and Edison came to Brno in 1911 to see it.

Right now, you are not obliged to have a residency card issued – until the end of 2020. However, the Czech government recommends doing so in order to prevent administrative difficulties in the future. The Temporary residence certificate is an easily-obtained residence card that will allow you to stay here after the transitional period (see the question How can I apply for the temporary residence certificate for EU citizen? above). Furthermore, the Czech Ministry of Interior recommends applying for a permanent residency card if you’ve stayed in the CR for at least five years. Do I always have to carry my residence card with me? Yes. What type of long-term residence permit can I apply for? You can apply for the same type of long-term residency as was the preceding long-term visa issued by a Czech embassy outside of the CR (if you don’t know what this means, go to the guide Visa and Residency that explains your obligations before arrival). The application for a long-term residency for a business purpose must follow the business visa and can be filed at the local Immigration office. How can I apply for a long-term residence permit?

(It is not possible to get it at the Foreign police at Cejl) Another option is to apply via postal mail for “A certificate of current residence” (download an application form).

For those who don’t mind a little less privacy and don’t want to spend much time in their room, we recommend one of Brno‘s hostels. For example, Mitte offers a distinctive and charming choice with a cafe right next to it. Other hostels include the one above the Fléda club on Štefániková Street, Eleven, Jacob, and u Minoritů. Find a complete list at\nwww.hostels.com. For the even more adventurous, Brno offers accommodation at more than 20 campsites around the city. We recommend trying one near the reservoir. They’re mostly open during summer and you can find a list at\nwww.camp.cz.\nNoticeably more comfortable, though more expensive, options include pensions, apartments, and especially hotels. You can find places with any number of stars. Choose one right in the city centre or from the varied offer in the calmer outskirts. Boutique and wellness facilities are on the rise and offer comfort and space to relax. The choices for accommodation also reflect the fact that Brno is still considered a city of trade fairs. Around the Brno Exhibition Centre are many congress hotels offering comfortable and easy access to specific exhibition halls. During the largest trade fairs, as well as during the motorcycle Grand Prix of the Czech Republic and large summer festivals, we recommend selecting and booking accommodation well in advance.

Each foreigner who wants to stay here for more than 3 months must be medically insured in the CR. There are two types of health insurance – public and commercial.\nAs the public health insurance is a public service not intended for the profit of the Czech government, it is of a much better value for your pocket, as well as security for your health. There are basically no limits for the coverage of the medical expenses and the insurance company cannot cancel your insurance or refuse to extend it if you fulfill required conditions.\nThis is different with the commercial health insurance. This insurance is not under such strict public control and gives insurance companies more room to benefit from the people insured. The monthly premium could be less than with the public insurance, but the coverage has lower limits at the same time. The doctors have more difficulties keeping the cost of medical services under the limits, and there is more paperwork for docs too. The biggest risk with the commercial health insurance is that the company can ditch the policy holder when he/she becomes too expensive and not extend the insurance when requested.\nYou cannot decide which insurance system you belong to.

If you have a job as an employee and are using the trade licence for a secondary income, then you are not required to pay monthly advances. The contribution for the previous year depends on the total business profit. When your income tax return is being prepared you or your accountant will also calculate whether the minimum health care contributions were enough or whether you must pay extra. Also, based on the income from the previous year, you will be informed by your accountant of the new monthly health care contribution for the current year. The amount is determined by the profit achieved in the previous year. The assessment base for calculation of health insurance is 50% of the profit (gross income minus expenses equals profit). The health care contribution is 13.5% of the assessment base. In most cases – where the lump sum for expenses is 60% – this effectively amounts to about 2.7% of the income. If the actual assessment base is lower than the minimum calculation basis, then the health care contribution is set at the minimum monthly advance mentioned above.

V rychlém sledu se střídaly i významy, které na sebe postmoderní tvarosloví nabíralo – od provokativního nositele svobodného názoru před rokem 1989 přes stvrzovatele nové politické a společenské situace po roce 1990 až po karikaturu malosti a tvůrčí impotence v jejím závěru. Význam a dopad postmoderny je pro československou situaci velmi specifický zvláště pak proto, že je součástí mentálního i faktického rozpadu nereformovatelného socialistického režimu. Je průvodní formou proměny československé společnosti od totalitního režimu k otevřenému demokratickému systému.

Snahou designu je každé chytré využití technického objevu, materiálu či uspokojení nové potřeby završit kultivovaným nebo nápaditým tvarem, barvou, povrchem.\nVzhledem k tomu, že průmyslová historie Brna, Moravy a českých zemí je mimořádně bohatá, rozhodli jsme se vyprávět příběh designu právě pomocí produktů, které vznikly na tomto území. Pojďme tedy přehlédnout panoráma předmětů, jež nám nastiňují jedinečný a neopakovatelný příběh designu, který je zároveň dostatečně nosný, abychom porozuměli principům, na kterých design věcí stojí."", ""url"": ""https://moravska-galerie.cz/vystavy/stale-expozice/art-design-fashion/"", ""date_fetched"": ""2024-05-16"", ""address"": ""Brno, Czech Republic"", ""dates"": ""[{\""start\"": \""1989\""}, {\""start\"": \""1990\""}]""}",2

Její dílo na první pohled zaujme svou koncentrovaností, smyslem pro rytmus, cykličnost, časovost. Do jisté míry je charakteristické také svojí určitou strohostí, nebo dokonce asketičností. Ukázněnost, s níž dotahuje cykly, soubory a svazky kreseb, akvarelů a grafik, a také spoléhání se na lapidární výrazové prostředky, patrně souvisí s hlubokou zkušeností s písmem, typografií a kaligrafií. Nepopiratelná je určitě také generační zkušenost umělkyně, která na přelomu padesátých a šedesátích let vystudovala volnou a užitou grafiku, design a knižní kulturu na Vysoké škole uměleckoprůmyslové v Praze, aby se poté natrvalo usadila v Brně, kde započala svoji samostatnou tvůrčí dráhu.\nRaná grafická díla Marie Filippovové se soustřeďují zejména na zachycení reality běžných předmětů, které autorka převádí na poetický znak se symbolickou hodnotou. Realitu městského života spojenou s pocitem nebe dokládá například její autorská kniha epigrafů Nebo nebe (1985), v níž se vzájemně kombinují krátké slovní hříčky s kresebným projevem.\nPostupem doby si Marie Filippovová vytvořila osobitý styl, kdy od figurativních témat přešla ke zcela autonomnímu projevu nezávislému na vnější podobě věcí. Zároveň nabyla v její tvorbě nového významu kresba, která se stála převažujícím, plnohodnotným výtvarným prostředkem. Od konce devadesátých let začala autorka vytvářet rozsáhlé cykly kreseb, často i velkoformátových expandujících do prostoru, v nichž ústřední námětovou roli převzala struktura složená z bodů. Nepravidelné body se pro autorku staly základním elementem tvorby, fundamentální výrazovou jednotkou díla.

He does appear at the castle, but before he will try to save the Princess he wants a guarantee that she has truly reformed and will keep her word. The Princess has the abolition of serfdom proclaimed and Jirkabegins to prepare for the arrival of Marbuela. He has an accomplice with him, Kate, whose hellish gold has changed into leaves and who now wants to get even with the devil. Jirka hides her under the table where the Princess awaits the devil with a prepared dinner. Marbuel appears but Jirka interrupts him. Marbuel warns him that he knows he mustn’t save the Princess. Only Jirka is there to tell him that Kate is waiting and wants to catch him again. At that moment the irate Kate emerges from under the table and all that is left of Marbuel is a puff of smoke. Everyone celebrates, Jirkais made a minister and Kate gets a cottage.

By their names already – Vladimir alias the Ruler of the Universe, and Estragon alias Wormwood – the two characters prefigure the style of the drama in which subtle irony intermingles with cruelty, child playfulness with the most deplorable instincts. It was Waiting for Godot (1949) that made Samuel Beckett (1906–1989), Irish novelist and playwright awarded Nobel Prize for Literature in 1969, the leading representative of absurd drama. His play reveals the bareness of the post-war word in which language becomes a witness of acts for which words are hard to find.

There lives a charming Duke wooing a graceful Lady, and a fairy tale drunkard terrorizing an ageing degenerate. For her own safety, Viola decides to disguise herself as a young man. But when she falls madly in love with Duke Orsino, she exposes herself to danger. In this comedy, whose deepest meaning is hidden in its subtitle, nobody can be sure of anything. It’s due to their poetic and dramatic brilliance that the plays of William Shakespeare (1564–1616) resonated with their public in such a way that they became an essential part of every repertoire. Written towards the end of the English Renaissance, the plays – in their tragic and comic aspects – deal with the forever relevant issues: the crisis of the individual and the crisis of identity.

Swan Lake is one of the world’s most performed and famous ballets.\nThe motives of Scandinavian folk tale and legend about a girl cursed to be a swan inspired Tchaikovsky to write this lyrical music. Music that later became the greatest example of a romantic ballet score. Princess Odette is enchanted by Baron Rothbart into a swan and can be saved only by true love. Prince Siegfried, who promised to love her, later betrays her and the curse remains unbroken, even though Odette eventually forgives the unhappy Prince. Swan Lake is now admired by generations of viewers and creators alike. Dancers are trying to eagerly match with the ambitious ballet technique. This production is staged with the traditional choreography by Marius Petipa and Lev Ivanov. It was staged by the long-term Ballet Master of the prestigious Italian theatre La Scala, Robert Strajner, who made the storyline clearer and added directorial concept. By highlighting the clarity of style and form, Swan Lake by Ballet NdB continues Petipaʼs and Ivanovʼs legacy, enriched by western European tradition in Strajner.\nThe restored premiere of this eternal story by Tchaikovsky was a significant event for Ballet NdB as it took place almost to the exact day of its world premiere in Brno, a hundred years ago. After twenty years in the NdB repertoire, set of this great production was completely re-designed. Exceptional financial support from out founder allowed us to work with renowned artists and further expand your experience of this legendary ballet piece. The new set design of this restored production is a work of an excellent English set designer, Peter Horne, who has also designed the set for The Nutcracker . Costumes are designed by Roman Šolc, who has been working alongside the Ballet NdB for more than 20 years now.

It was founded in 1936 but it had not developed its activities fully before the war started. It reestablished its activities in 1948 and its task was to concentrate and process materials related to Moravian farming history. At the beginning of 1951, the association was nationalized and began its new operation as a branch of the National Technical Museum in Prague. In 1952 the branch was allowed to create its own collection.\nIn 1956 the museum obtained a convent building of the St. Voršila order located at the corner of Orlí and Josefská streets in Brno which was built in the 17th century in Baroque style. It was an important moment for the museum. The building was in a very devastated condition and it was reconstructed step by step and rebuilt for the needs of the museum.\nMany years’ effort for museum documentation of the technical progress in Moravia came true on the 1st of January 1961 when the Brno branch of the National Technical Museum in Prague set up on its own as the Technical Museum in Brno. Since this year the museum has started to bring benefits to the society as an independent institution which has been engaged in the documentation of progress in science and technology and industrial production in a large spectrum of nearly thirty fields – from handcrafts to contemporary computer technology. The displays have been built since 1969 when the first display called Water Energetics was created.\nThe TMB employees were also interested in historical production compounds located on the place of its original existence – the Technical Monuments. Currently, the museum manages six of them. Five of them are located in the South Moravia region – Stará huť u Adamova with its Iron and Steel Industry display, the Baroque forge in Těšany with Smithery and Wheelwright display, the windmill in Kuželov with its Windmilling Industry display, watermill in Slup with its Milling Technology display and the Complex of the Czechoslovak fortification system in Šatov.

To mark this occasion, the philharmonic prepared a concert titled 'Smetana 200 & Davies 80', which featured a cycle of symphonic poems called 'Má vlast' by Bedřich Smetana. The concert took place on Thursday, April 18, at the Besední dům, symbolically linking Smetana's and Davies' jubilees. However, 'Má vlast' did not sound in its traditional orchestral version but in a transcription for four-hand piano, which Davies himself created shortly after completing the cycle. Dennis Russell Davies did not appear as a conductor this time but as a pianist, accompanied by his life and artistic partner Maki Namekawa. The entire concert was accompanied by visualizations by Cori O'Lana and an artistic performance by Michal Bumbálek.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the year 2024 is regularly remembered in the Czech Republic as the Year of Czech Music. However, it is obvious that anniversaries do not only belong to Czech composers and their works but also to foreign authors or those whose Czechness could be disputed. A program with a fitting title 'Rhapsody in Blue 100', composed of two compositions celebrating their round anniversaries this year, with the addition of a piece by last year's jubilant, was performed on Thursday, April 11, 2024, at the Janáček Theatre by the Brno Philharmonic under the direction of Dennis Russell Davies, who also appeared as a piano soloist.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, a concert titled 'Unknown Leoš Janáček and the Beginnings of Baroque' was performed by the ensemble Musica Florea, focusing on informed interpretation. Founded in 1992 by cellist and conductor Marek Štryncl, the ensemble has been organizing special concert series since 2002, focusing on presenting newly discovered and well-known compositions. The evening dedicated to Janáček's small liturgical choir works with Latin texts and predominantly instrumental early Baroque pieces represents a concert series, featuring soloists Barbora Kotlánová (soprano), Stanislava Mihalcová (soprano), Daniela Čermáková (alto), Hasan El Dunia (tenor), and Jaromír Nosek (bass)."", ""url"": ""http://www.mestohudby.cz/"", ""date_fetched"": ""2024-05-16"", ""address"": ""Brno, Czech Republic"", ""dates"": ""[{\""start\"": \""2024-04-16\""}, {\""start\"": \""2024-04-11\"", \""end\"": \""2024-04-18\""}]""}",2

With a concert called Ensemble Inégal: Yesterday at the church of St. John, Zelenka opened the 31st edition of the Easter Festival of Sacred Music, this time with the suffix Terroir. This slightly mysterious word, which is popularly used in connection with wine, comes from the Latin word for land or soil, and carries the sum of all the influences, especially the natural conditions of a particular location and on the plants grown there. This term is thus metonymically transferred to the programme of this year's VFDH, as it consists exclusively of works by Czech authors, thus complementing the ongoing Year of Czech Music. For the fourth subscription concert of the Philharmonic at Home series, which took place on 14 March at the Besední dům and was entitled Mozartiana, the Brno Philharmonic, this time under the direction of Czech-Japanese conductor Chuhei Iwasaki, chose four works from the 18th to 20th centuries. These works are dramaturgically linked either directly through their creation in the Classical period or by inspiration from musical practices typical of that period. The first half of the concert featured Martina Venc Matušínská with a solo flute. The second stop on the short Neues Klavier Trio Dresden's Czech-German tour was at the concert hall of the Janáček Academy of Music on 6 March at 16:00.
