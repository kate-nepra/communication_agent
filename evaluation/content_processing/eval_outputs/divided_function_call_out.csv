17th century
In 1641, during the
Thirty Years' War, the Holy Roman Emperor and Margrave of Moravia
Ferdinand III
ordered the permanent relocation of the diet, court, and the land tables from Olomouc to Brno, as Olomouc's
Collegium Nordicum
made it one of the primary targets of Swedish armies.
In 1642 Olomouc surrendered to the
Swedish Army, which occupied it for eight years.
Meanwhile, Brno, as the only Moravian city which, under the leadership of
Jean-Louis Raduit de Souches, succeeded in defending itself from the Swedes under General
Lennart Torstenson, served as the sole capital of the Margraviate of Moravia. After the end of the Thirty Years' War in 1648, Brno retained its status as the sole capital. This was later confirmed by the Holy Roman Emperor
Joseph II
in 1782, and again in 1849 by the Moravian constitution.
Today, the Moravian Land Tables are stored in the
Moravian Regional Archive, and are included among the national cultural sights of the Czech Republic.
During the 17th century
Špilberk Castle
was rebuilt as a huge baroque
citadel.
Brno was besieged by the
Prussian Army
in 1742 under the leadership of
Frederick the Great, but the siege was ultimately unsuccessful. In 1777 the
bishopric of Brno
was established by the
Catholic Church;
Mathias Franz Graf von Chorinsky Freiherr von Ledske
was the first Bishop.
19th century
In December 1805 the
Battle of Austerlitz
was fought near the city; the battle is also known as the ""Battle of the Three Emperors"". Brno itself was not involved with the battle, but the French Emperor
Napoleon Bonaparte
spent several nights here at that time, and again in 1809.
In 1839 the first train arrived in Brno from Vienna; this was the beginning of
rail transport in what is now the Czech Republic.
In the years 1859–1864 the city fortifications were almost completely removed. In 1869 a
horsecar
service started to operate in Brno, the first
tram service
in what would later become the Czech Republic.

Local legends
There are several legends connected with the City of Brno. One of the best known is the Legend of the Brno Dragon.
According to this legend, a terrible creature was terrorizing the citizens of Brno. The people had never seen this animal before, so they called it a dragon. They lived in fear of the dragon until one citizen managed to kill the monster by tricking it into eating a carcass filled with lime. In reality the dragon was a crocodile, the preserved body of which is now displayed at the entrance of the
Old Town Hall. Crocodile and dragon motifs are common in Brno. A crocodile (Czech:
krokodýl) is the local stuffed baguette, and the city radio station is known as Radio Krokodýl. The local
baseball
team is named
Draci Brno (English:
Brno Dragons) and the local rugby club is named
RC Dragon Brno. There is also a local
American football
team called the
Brno Alligators. An
Intercity
train connecting Brno and
Prague
is called Brněnský drak (English:
The Brno dragon).
Next to the ""dragon"" at the Old Town Hall is the town's second well-known emblem, a wagon wheel made from a tree found and cut down 50 miles from the city. According to the legend, a local man made a wager that he could fell the tree, make a wheel out of it, and roll the wheel to the City of Brno, all within a single day. Since the achievement was deemed to be impossible by normal human means, the man was believed to have called on the devil for assistance, and died in poverty as a result.
Another local legend relates to the siege of the city by Swedish forces in 1645. The locals and the Swedish army were in a stalemate, and the Swedish general declared that he would withdraw if his army had not won by noon. The bell ringer at Petrov Cathedral tricked him by ringing the bell an hour early, and keeping his word, the general and his army left. As a historic tribute to the event, the bell at Petrov Cathedral still rings for noon an hour earlier, at 11 o'clock. At this time, the Brno astronomical clock also releases a glass ball as a souvenir.

In the early 11th century Brno was established as a castle of a non-ruling prince from the
House of Přemyslid, and Brno became one of the centres of Moravia along with
Olomouc
and
Znojmo. Brno was first mentioned in Cosmas'
Chronica Boemorum
dated to the year 1091, when Bohemian king
Vratislaus II
besieged his brother
Conrad
at Brno castle.
In the mid 11th century, Moravia was divided into three separate territories; each had its own ruler, coming from the
Přemyslids
dynasty, but independent of the other two, and subordinate only to the
Bohemian
ruler in
Prague. The seats of these rulers and thus the ""capitals"" of these territories were the castles and towns of Brno, Olomouc, and
Znojmo. In the late 12th century, Moravia began to reunify, forming the
Margraviate of Moravia. From then until the mid of the 17th century, it was not clear which town should be the capital of Moravia. Political power was divided between Brno and Olomouc, but Znojmo also played an important role. The Moravian Diet, the Moravian Land Tables, and the Moravian Land Court were all seated in both cities at once.
However, Brno was the official seat of the Moravian Margraves (rulers of Moravia), and later its geographical position closer to
Vienna
also became important. Otherwise, until 1642 Olomouc had a larger population than Brno, and was the seat of the only
Roman Catholic
diocese
in Moravia.
In 1243 Brno was granted the large and small city privileges
by the King, and was thus recognized as a royal city. As throughout Eastern Central Europe, the granting of city privileges was connected with
immigration from German-speaking lands. In 1324 Queen
Elisabeth Richeza of Poland
founded the
Basilica of the Assumption of Our Lady, which now houses her grave.
In the 14th century, Brno became one of the centres for the Moravian regional assemblies, whose meetings alternated between Brno and Olomouc.
These assemblies made political, legal, and financial decisions. Brno and Olomouc were also the seats of the Land Court and the
Moravian Land Tables, thus they were the two most important cities in Moravia. From the mid 14th century to the early 15th century, Špilberk Castle had served as the permanent seat of the Margraves of Moravia; one of them was elected the
King of the Romans. Brno was besieged in 1428 and again in 1430 by the

20th century and Greater Brno
Around 1900 Brno, which consisted in administrative terms only of the central city area until 1918, had a predominantly
German-speaking population (63%), as opposed to the suburbs, which were predominantly Czech-speaking.
Life in the city was therefore bilingual, and what was called in German ""Brünnerisch"" was a mixed idiom containing elements from both languages.
In 1919, after
World War I, two neighbouring towns, Královo Pole and Husovice, and 21 other municipalities were annexed to Brno, creating Greater Brno (Czech:
Velké Brno). This was done to dilute the German-speaking majority of close to 55,000
by the addition of the Czech communities of the city's neighborhood. Included in the German-speaking group were almost all of the 12,000 Jewish inhabitants, including several of the city's better known personalities, who made a substantial contribution to the city's cultural life.
Greater Brno was almost seven times larger, with a population of about 222,000 – before that Brno had about 130,000 inhabitants.
In 1921 Brno became the capital of the Land of Moravia (Czech: země Moravská ). Seven years later, Brno became the capital of the Land of Moravia-Silesia (Czech: země Moravskoslezská ).
In 1930, 200,000 inhabitants declared themselves to be of Czech, and some 52,000 of German nationality, in both cases including the respective Jewish citizens.
During the
German occupation of the Czech lands
between 1939 and 1945, all Czech universities were closed by the Nazis, including those in Brno. The
Faculty of Law
became the headquarters of the
Gestapo, and the university hall of residence was used as a prison. About 35,000 Czechs and some American and British
prisoners of war
were imprisoned and tortured there; about 800 civilians were executed or died.
Executions were public.
The Nazis also operated a
subcamp
of the
Auschwitz concentration camp, which held mostly Polish prisoners, an internment camp for
Romani people
in the city, and a

extermination camp, 995 people transported from Brno died there. Only 1,033 people returned after the war.
Industrial facilities such as the
Československá zbrojovka
arms factory and the Zweigwerk
aircraft engine
factory (which became Zbrojovka's subsidiary
Zetor
after the war) and the city centre were targeted by several
Allied
bombardment
campaigns between 1944 and 1945. The air strikes and later artillery fire killed some 1,200 people and destroyed 1,278 buildings.
After the city's occupation by the
Red Army
on 26 April 1945
and the end of the
war, ethnic German residents were
expelled. In the
Brno death march, beginning on 31 May 1945, about 27,000 German inhabitants of Brno were marched 64 kilometres (40 miles) to the Austrian border. According to testimony collected by German sources, about 5,200 of them died during the march.
Later estimates by Czech sources put the death toll at about 1,700, with most deaths due to an epidemic of
shigellosis.
After the reestablishment of an
independent Czechoslovak state
after
World War II, Prime Minister
Edvard Beneš
delivered a speech in Brno demanding the
expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia. Shortly afterwards, 20,000 ethnic Germans from the city were expelled into
Allied-occupied Austria.
After the
1948 Czechoslovak coup d'état, the
Czechoslovak Socialist Republic
abolished Moravian autonomy and Brno thus ceased to be the capital of Moravia.
Since then Moravia has been divided into administrative regions, with Brno the administrative centre of the
South Moravian Region.
In 1960s and 1970s, large panel
housing estates
were built in border districts, such as Bohunice, Líšeň, Bystrc and Vinohrady. During the communist era, most of the workforce was employed in industry, mainly machinery.
After 1989, part of the workforce switched from industry to services, and Brno became the IT centre of the Czech Republic. Nevertheless, new industrial zones were built at the edge of the city, such as Černovická terasa in the east of the city.

Since the 1990s Brno has experienced a great cultural ""rebirth"": façades of historical monuments are being repaired and various exhibitions, shows, etc., are being established or extended. In 2007 a summit of 15 presidents of EU Member States was held in Brno.
Despite its urban character, some of the city districts still preserve traditional Moravian folklore, including folk festivals with traditional Moravian costumes, Moravian wines, folk music and dances. Unlike smaller municipalities, in Brno annual traditional Moravian folk festivals are held in several city districts, including
Židenice, Líšeň, and

While the Brno Jewish community numbered 12,000 in 1938, only 1,000 survived
Nazi
persecution during Germany's occupation in
World War II.
Today, the cemetery and synagogue are again maintained by a Brno Jewish community. The only Czech
mosque, founded in 1998, is also located in Brno.

Theatres
Brno has a long theatre tradition. Brno has the oldest theatre building in Central Europe, the
Reduta Theatre
on
Zelný trh.
The first theatre plays in Brno probably took place in the 1660s in the
City Tavern, today's Reduta Theatre; however, the first theatre with
boxes
was built in this complex in 1733.
The first documented professional Czech performance took place in 1767, again in the Reduta Theatre; the play was called
Zamilovaný ponocný (English:
Watchman in Love) and was performed by the
Venice Theatre Company. The same year, Mozart
performed in the theatre with his elder sister Anna Maria (Nannerl).
In that year the Mozart family spent Christmas in Brno, and their visit is commemorated by a statue of Mozart as a child in front of the Reduta Theatre. The theatre's
Mozart Hall
was also named after him.
The
Národní divadlo v Brně (English:
National Theatre of Brno; NdB) is the leading producer of
opera, drama, and
ballet
in the city of Brno. The first permanent seat of NdB was established in 1884, and today this institution owns the
Mahen Theatre, built in 1882, Janáček Theatre, built in 1965, and the
Reduta Theatre.
The composer
Leoš Janáček
is also connected with the National Theatre of Brno.
The Mahen Theatre was the first theatre building in Europe to be illuminated by
Thomas Edison
's
electric light bulbs; at that time it was a completely new invention and there were no power plants built in the city, so a small steam power plant was built nearby just to power the theatre, and Edison came to Brno in 1911 to see it.
The most commercially successful theatre in Brno is the
Brno City Theatre, founded in 1945;
its performances are usually sold out. They also stage about 150 performances abroad every year.
The theatre's repertoire consists primarily of musical and dramatic shows.
There are a variety of smaller theatres in Brno, including the
Bolek Polivka
Theatre, the Goose on a String Theatre (""Divadlo Husa na provázku""), HaDivadlo, Radost Puppet Theatre (""loutkové divadlo Radost""), and Polárka Theatre.
The Mahen Theatre was originally called the City Theatre, and until 1918 it performed exclusively in German and was not part of the National Theatre of Brno. Between 1971 and 1978, some plays were performed at the
Brno Exhibition Centre
due to reconstruction of the Mahen Theatre.",static,place,place,,static,,place,"BaseSchema(header='Theatre Tradition in Brno', record_type='place', brief='Brno has a rich theatre history with its first documented professional Czech performance taking place in 1767.

The first theatre plays in Brno probably took place in the 1660s in the City Tavern, today\'s Reduta Theatre; however, the first theatre with boxes was built in this complex in 1733. The first documented professional Czech performance took place in 1767, again in the Reduta Theatre; the play was called Zamilovaný ponocný (English: Watchman in Love) and was performed by the Venice Theatre Company. The same year, Mozart performed in the theatre with his elder sister Anna Maria (Nannerl). In that year the Mozart family spent Christmas in Brno, and their visit is commemorated by a statue of Mozart as a child in front of the Reduta Theatre. The theatre\'s Mozart Hall was also named after him. The Národní divadlo v Brně (English: National Theatre of Brno; NdB) is the leading producer of opera, drama, and ballet in the city of Brno. The first permanent seat of NdB was established in 1884, and today this institution owns the Mahen Theatre, built in 1882, Janáček Theatre, built in 1965, and the Reduta Theatre. The composer Leoš Janáček is also connected with the National Theatre of Brno. The Mahen Theatre was the first theatre building in Europe to be illuminated by Thomas Edison\'s electric light bulbs; at that time it was a completely new invention and there were no power plants built in the city, so a small steam power plant was built nearby just to power the theatre, and Edison came to Brno in 1911 to see it. The most commercially successful theatre in Brno is the Brno City Theatre, founded in 1945; its performances are usually sold out. They also stage about 150 performances abroad every year. The theatre\'s repertoire consists primarily of musical and dramatic shows. There are a variety of smaller theatres in Brno, including the Bolek Polivka Theatre, the Goose on a String Theatre (""Divadlo Husa na provázku""), HaDivadlo, Radost Puppet Theatre (""loutkové divadlo Radost""), and Polárka Theatre.', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brno', date_fetched='2024-04-28', address='Brno, Czech Republic')",,"BaseSchema(header='Theatre Tradition in Brno', record_type='static', brief='Brno has a long theatre tradition with various theatres and venues throughout the city.', text='The theatres in Brno have a long tradition with the oldest theatre building in Central Europe, the Reduta Theatre on Zelný trh.

Economy
Since 1990, many companies created or spun off as part of privatization from former national enterprises have disappeared.
Before 1990, engineering companies were very important in Brno; since then, the city's economy has largely reoriented itself towards light industry, logistics, and services. The city later gained importance in other fields of
engineering, especially in
software development. After 2000, foreign technology companies began establishing their branches in Brno, and many Czech companies with local or global reach were also founded here.
Companies operating in Brno include
Gen Digital (one of the headquarters, brand
AVG Technologies
still used), Kyndryl (Client Innovation Centre), AT&T, Honeywell (Global Design Center), Siemens, Red Hat (Czech headquarters),, an office of
Zebra Technologies, and formerly
Silicon Graphics International (Czech headquarters).
In recent years, the quaternary sector of the economy, i.e., activities in science, research, and education, has also begun to develop in Brno. Examples include AdMaS (Advanced Materials, Structures, and Technologies) or CETOCOEN (Center for Research on Toxic Substances in the Environment).

In 1969 Brno hosted the UCI Track Cycling World Championships and UCI Road World Championships for amateurs, in 1981 the UCI Track Cycling World Championships and in 2001 the UEC European Track Championships for the U23 category. There are two traditional cycling teams: TJ Favorit Brno and Dukla Brno. The 2010 FIBA World Championship for Women was played in Brno's Arena Vodova, with the Czech squad taking the silver medal. There is a horse-race course at Brno-Dvorská and an aeroclub airport in Medlánky. Several sports clubs represent the city in the various Czech leagues, including FC Zbrojovka Brno (football), HC Kometa Brno (ice hockey), KP Brno (handball), BC Brno (basketball, men) and BK Brno (women), four baseball teams (Draci Brno, Hroši Brno, VSK Technika Brno, MZLU Express Brno), Brno Ravens Lacrosse Club (lacrosse), Brno Alligators (American football), two rugby teams (RC Dragon Brno, RC Bystrc) and others. Tennis players Barbora Krejčíková, Lucie Šafářová, Lukáš Rosol, and Jana Novotná are from Brno, as well as Michal Březina, one of the top Czech figure skaters. Motorcycle speedway events were held at the Winter Stadium, off Na Rybníčku in Králové Pole. The venue hosted a final round of the Czechoslovak Individual Speedway Championship in 1949, 1950 and 1954. Public transport in Brno consists of 12 tram lines, 14 trolleybus lines (the largest trolleybus network in the Czech Republic) and almost 40 day and 11 night bus lines. Trams (known locally as šaliny) first appeared on the streets in 1869; this was the first operation of horse-drawn trams in the modern-day Czech Republic. The local public transport system is interconnected with regional public transport in one integrated system (IDS JMK), and directly connects several nearby municipalities with the city. Its main operator is the Brno City Transport Company (DPmB), which also operates a mostly recreational ferry route at the Brno Dam Lake. A tourist minibus provides a brief tour of the city. In 2011, the city announced plans to build a metro system light rail system to alleviate overcrowding of trams and to reduce congestion on the surface."", url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brno', date_fetched='2024-04-28', address=None)",,"BaseSchema(header='Sports and Transportation Overview in Brno', record_type='static', brief='Brno features a significant sports culture, particularly in cycling with its historically significant velodrome and multiple cycling championships hosted.

Railway transport began operating in the city in 1839 on the Brno–Vienna line, the first operating railway line in the modern-day Czech Republic.
Today, Brno is a transnational railway hub, with nine stations for passenger traffic. The current
main railway station
is the central hub of regional train services, used by about 50,000 passengers every day, with around 500 trains passing through. The station is currently operating at full capacity;
the main station building is outdated and lacks sufficient operating capacity, but the construction of the new station has been postponed several times for various reasons.
A
referendum
over whether to move the station was held on 7 and 8 October 2016, coinciding with
regional elections.
Brno is also an international road transport crossroads. There are two
motorways
on the southern edge of the city: the D1 leading to
Ostrava
and
Prague, and the D2 leading to
Bratislava.
Not far from the city limits is the
D52 motorway
leading to
Vienna. Another planned motorway, the
D43, will connect Brno to northwestern Moravia.
The city is gradually building the large city
ring road (road I/42). Several road tunnels have been built at Pisarky, Husovice, Hlinky, and Královo pole, and more are planned.
Due to the congestion in private transport, the city is continuing to try to build more
parking ramps, including underground, but these efforts have not always been successful.
Air transport is enabled by two functional airports. The public international airport, Brno–Tuřany Airport, saw a sharp increase in passenger traffic up to 2011, however the number of passengers declined in the following years, especially during the
COVID-19 pandemic. The airport also serves as one of the two bases for police helicopters in the Czech Republic. The other airport, Medlánky Airport, is a small domestic airport serving mainly recreational activities such as flying
hot air balloons, gliders
or aircraft
RC models.
Cycling is widespread in Brno due to lowland nature of the landscape. Existing tracks for cycling and roller skating in 2011 totalled approximately 38 kilometres (24 mi), and are gradually being expanded.
There is also one long
bikeway
leading to
Vienna, approximately 130 kilometres (81 mi) long.
Several hiking trails of the Czech Tourist Club also pass through Brno.

Do I need a permit to enter and stay in the CR?
Yes, you do. If you are planning to stay in the Czech Republic for over 90 days, you need to obtain
a long-term visa
or
a long-term residence.
Applicants for the visa have to specify a purpose for their stay in the Czech Republic and apply for the appropriate visa at
Embassy of the Czech Republic. The purpose of stay might be employment, business, scientific research, studies, family reunification, culture or other.
The Czech Embassy is only authorized to receive an application for a long-term visa; the competent authority for processing it is the Ministry of Interior (MOI). During the procedure, the Czech Embassy communicates with you, invites you for a hearing and calls on you to pick up the visa. Please note that the competent authority for processing your long-term visa or a long-term residency is the Ministry of Interior (MOI).
How do I apply for the visa?
You can apply for
a long-term visa for a purpose of family
or
a long-term residence for a purpose of family reunification.
An application for a long-term visa or residence for the purpose of family reunification can primarily be filed by a foreign national who is a spouse or a child of a foreign national (nonEU) who is already in possession of a long-term residence (i.e. employee card) or permanent residence permit in the Czech Republic. However, a spouse or a child can apply for visa or residence permit at the same time with the person they are reunification with.
You should file an application for a long-term visa at
Embassy of the Czech Republic.
For the complete list and requirements contact your local Czech embassy or visit the
Immigration office website.
If you are a family member (spouse, partner, child, parent) of an EU citizen, you can apply for a temporary residence permit. An application can be filled in person at any MOI (Ministry of Inferior) office in the Czech Republic within 3 months of entering the country (i.e. Schengen visa).

General info
To be insured for medical expenses is not only a legal obligation in the Czech Republic, but also a life necessity. Each foreigner who wants to stay here for more than 3 months must be medically insured in the CR. There are two types of health insurance – public and commercial.
As the
public health insurance
is a public service not intended for the profit of the Czech government, it is of a much better value for your pocket, as well as security for your health. There are basically no limits for the coverage of the medical expenses and the insurance company cannot cancel your insurance or refuse to extend it if you fulfill required conditions.
This is different with the
commercial health insurance. This insurance is not under such strict public control and gives insurance companies more room to benefit from the people insured. The monthly premium could be less than with the public insurance, but the coverage has lower limits at the same time. The doctors have more difficulties keeping the cost of medical services under the limits, and there is more paperwork for docs too. The biggest risk with the commercial health insurance is that the company can ditch the policy holder when he/she becomes too expensive and not extend the insurance when requested.
You cannot decide which insurance system you belong to. This is strictly determined by your nationality or personal/economical situation. You cannot switch between the systems as you wish. Use the filters above to find answers for your questions based on your personal situation.

Can I interrupt or change or opt out of the insurance system?
You cannot switch the public insurance system to commercial insurance or vice versa. If you are resident in the CR (for more than 3 months or as soon as economically active), you have to participate in the public health insurance system.
In case your life or work situation changes (e.g. your job finishes), you need to recontact your public health insurance company to make sure you remain in the public health insurance system in the right category (job seeker, parent looking after a minor child etc.).
You can take a break from the insurance payments in case you decide to move out form the Czech Republic for a longer period of time (3 months or more) with no intention to return any time soon but you need to deregister first.
However, if you are a holder of a permanent residency permit, you can only opt out of the public health insurance system in case you leave the country for over 6 months and inform your health insurance company in writing in advance.

What does my insurance card cover?
The public health insurance covers all services that are intended to improve or maintain the health of the insured, or to alleviate his or her suffering. The insurance covers both ambulatory and institutional care, preventive care, the provision of medicines, drugs or medical devices, spa care and others.
This healthcare is provided free of charge to you in a healthcare facility that has a contract with your health insurance provider. However, in the case of acute need for medical treatment, you may not be refused in a medical facility that does not have a contract.
Only the basic material and treatment is paid in the case of dental treatment. Only a small part of healthcare is excluded from the health insurance, for example cosmetic surgery without any health reason.
You always have to have the insurance card for every visit to a doctor or medical facility and, in case you have medicine from doctor’s prescription, for collecting your medicines at a pharmacy.
What insurance companies are there? Can I choose between them?
There are seven public insurance companies. You can choose between them freely.

Who pays my insurance and how much is it?
If self-employment is your main economic activity, the amount paid in contributions depends on your income, but the minimum is 2,722 CZK/month (2023). In the first year of their trade licence, everyone starts with the minimum health care contribution, regardless of the (expected) annual income.
If you have a job as an employee and are using the trade licence for a secondary income, then you are not required to pay monthly advances. The contribution for the
previous year depends on the total business profit.
When your income tax return is being prepared you or your accountant will also calculate whether the minimum health care contributions were enough or whether you must pay extra. Also, based on the income from the previous year, you will be informed by your accountant of the new monthly health care contribution for the current year.
The amount is determined by the profit achieved in the previous year. The assessment base for calculation of health insurance is 50% of the profit (gross income minus expenses equals profit). The health care contribution is 13.5% of the assessment base. In most cases – where the lump sum for expenses is 60% – this effectively amounts to about 2.7% of the income.
If the actual assessment base is lower than the minimum calculation basis, then the health care contribution is set at the minimum monthly advance mentioned above.

Can I interrupt or change or opt out of the insurance system?
You cannot switch the public insurance system to commercial insurance or vice versa. If you are resident in the CR (for more than 3 months or as soon as economically active), you have to participate in the public health insurance system.
In case your life or work situation changes (e.g. your job finishes), you need to recontact your public health insurance company to make sure you remain in the public health insurance system in the right category (job seeker, parent looking after a minor child etc.).
You can take a break from the insurance payments in case you decide to move out form the Czech Republic for a longer period of time (3 months or more) with no intention to return any time soon but you need to deregister first.
However, if you are a holder of a permanent residency permit, you can only opt out of the public health insurance system in case you leave the country for over 6 months and inform your health insurance company in writing in advance. You will only be allowed to return back to the system if you can prove that you were medically insured abroad during the whole period of time when you were absent.

What type of long-term residence permit can I apply for?
There are three options:
If you have arrived in the CR with a “visa for the purpose of collecting an employee card” issued by a Czech embassy, you have to go to the Immigration office within three business days and pick up your Employee card . Later you can extend the validity of the card or change the purpose of stay to a different residence permit.
If you have arrived in the CR with a short term visa for up to 90 days for the purpose of employment, or you are staying in the CR as a visitor without a visa, and you wish to continue to stay and work in the CR, you have to fill out a new application for the long-term
Employee card
at a Czech embassy abroad (to learn more about this process, read the guide
Visa and Residency
that explains your obligations before arrival). Expect to allow over three months for the proceedings.
If you have been staying in the CR with a long-term residence permit for some other purpose (study, business, family…) and you would like to switch the purpose of stay to employment, you can apply for the Employee card at the Immigration office in Brno. Read the answer to the question “How can I apply for an employee card?” below.
What is a blue card?
Similar to an Employee card, but different. It is a residential status and work permit designed for a long-term stay involving the performance of a highly skilled job .
An EU Blue card entitles a foreign national to stay and work in the CR the same way as the Employee card does. However, foreigners with the Blue card have some advantages – such as switching a job, adding up the periods of stay from all EU countries, having spouses with free access to the labour market from day one etc.
On the other hand, there are some higher requirements for the application – a university degree recognized in the CR, a gross salary higher than 150% of the Czech average (ie. over cca 60.000 CZK a month in 2022), longer processing time. And it is your first employer in the CR who has to agree and open a position available for a Blue card holder.
Find out more about the Blue card at the
Immigration office website.

The Made by Fire exhibition commemorates the 150th anniversary of the founding of The Museum of Applied Arts of The Moravian Gallery in Brno. Experience the power and fragility of Bohemian glass and porcelain in their trial by fire.
Glass and porcelain are somewhat of a national treasure. They have a long tradition and a unique place in Czech culture. But what do these terms mean today? Faced with one crisis after another – social, ecological and geopolitical – does it still make sense to develop glass and porcelain into the future?
We believe it does, and we are convinced that the disclaimer “Made in Czechia“ has a bright future ahead, both with standard factories as well as small art studios.
All 50+ original works featured as part of the exhibition have a common origin – their glass, porcelain and ceramics were made in the fires of Czech furnaces and kilns. We selected pieces from prestigious glass producers and exporters, the foremost porcelain works, the major players on the design scene, as well as the up-and-coming generation of designers whose work it pays to follow.
The exhibition will take you through four thematic sections: Industry → , Adaptation → , Identity → and Experiment → .
You will encounter works which test the limits of applied art and deal with contemporary social problems, such as industry competitiveness, its environmental impact, the use of classical forms, and the implementation of new technologies.

You can’t go wrong with a comedy staged by the director Ondřej Havelka, especially when it’s a comedy by Giuseppe Verdi. Perhaps you wouldn´t expect this genre from a composer of famous tragic operas, but there you would be wrong, as in actual fact Verdi wanted to write a comedy all his life, but only got round to it with his last opera. And so a masterpiece inspired by the famous Shakespearean figure, Sir John Falstaff, was created.
Falstaff, a resident of the Garter Inn, enjoys partaking of good food and drink, but is particularly interested in the local Windsor ladies Alice Ford and Meg Page. The fact that they are both married doesn´t bother him at all; on the contrary, it only adds spice to his desires. Meg and Alice don´t care for his affections, and, with the help of Mistress Quicky, entangle him in their webs and teach him a proper lesson. However, Falstaff concludes this bittersweet comedy with the wise words: “The whole world is a farce.” Verdi, who had experienced a lot himself and knew how to enjoy life, left the world a comic opera that is hard to match. Smart and witty, with occasional subtle parodies of Verdi´s typical heroic performances, full of ensemble numbers which are clearly inspired by Rossini, and with humour overflowing with understanding for all that is human, such is his Falstaff that is returning to the Brno stage after fifty years away.

In Autoteatro, individuals become both the actors and the audience, blurring the traditional boundaries between performer and spectator. Audience is entering the skin of protagonists of the play, becoming its main characters.
Autoteatro takes place directly in a café during regular opening hours. Participants receive headphones through which they receive all the instructions. The experience is also guided by specially trained actors who enhance the overall atmosphere of the play.

What was it like growing up in a time when one had to be a communist or face repressions that could cost one’s life?
Both Kaněrová and Adamec shared their memories with the Institute of National Memory. Students from JAMU (Janáček Academy of Performing Arts), under the guidance of Monika Okurková, transformed these memories into immersive theater for two spectators.

kolektiv fau: Rauschen
PLACEK Festival is presenting German theatre colective fau and their performance Rauschen! First time in Brno
The world today is one of a constant background noise: there\’s a podcast on at all times, a discussion, a Tik-Tok video is chasing the next one and it doesn\’t matter how quiet it is – it\’s never actually silent – since our minds won\’t stop reproducing the rhythms around us. In \”Rauschen\” we are searching for the off-switch. We are trying to escape the chaos of everyday life, and instead listen to what silence sounds like, feels like, what it means to break through the static. If this is even possible.
The fau collective are Melanie Klos, Paul Schliermann and Jakob Grundherr. They have been studying theater and media studies at the University of Bayreuth since 2019. Their atmospheric works focus on experiments mapping the intersection of sound, light, video and performance.

“There is always hope. It’s not over until the body is cold!” – Ruth Wolff
Ruth Wolff is the chief physician at an institute for neurological patients. She admits a 14-year-old girl who hasn’t much time to live, trying to give her the most peaceful departure. The next morning, after a tumultuous night, an unexpected visitor shows up at the door of the young patient: the priest from the parish to which the girl’s parents belong. He has come to give her the last sacrament. By refusing an unknown and uninvited priest permission to enter the patient’s room, the physician creates a chaotic situation, resulting in what could be termed a witch hunt. But why didn’t anyone listen to the priest? And was the girl Catholic or not? Was the priest treated in an unjust, aggressive way? And did the doctor do this, perhaps, because she herself is Jewish?
This variation on Schnitzler’s key drama Professor Bernhardi, by the British playwright and screenwriter Robert Icke, returns to the fundamental themes of the early twentieth century themes which are unfortunately still (or perhaps again?) frighteningly topical. It shows that even those who have dedicated their lives to the healing of others might be affected by racial and religious prejudice spread in the public domain without proper justification. And however absurd it is to base one’s decisions about a dying patient on confused public opinion, these things do happen.

Dominated by masterstrokes of vivacious acting, this dynamic commedia dell´arte gives the audience an intense theatrical experience crowned by astonishing numbers sung by both actors and opera singers. An incredibly sophisticated systems of backdrops and drapes enriches the spectators’ visual delight.
The peculiar owner of an inn in Florence, as we know her from Carlo Goldoni’s comedy, is a very competent woman who is more versed in business than anybody else. Both the pub and the rooms are always full and many clients long to win her affection. Some of them let it show rather ostentatiously, such as the impoverished yet boastful Marquis Di Forlipopoli and the upstart, self-centred Earl d’Albafiorit. Even though serving such importunate admirers might seem amusing, the lively innkeeper finds their obtuseness gruelling. Being a jovial person, she sits up and takes notice when baron Di Ripafratta – a sworn adversary of women – walks into her pub. Mirandolina is closely bound to the starring actress Tereza Groszmannová, whose translation of the play is custom-made both for herself and her fellow actors. The characters express themselves with a well-timed vigour, allowing dynamic acting. The highly pertinent and jaunty language of the script plays skilfully with ambiguities.

You can bet that there are some mischievous tales involved!

Drama
05/05/2024 17:00 - 19:45
Being happy is possible! But maybe at some other place or at some other time …
After the decease of their father, who provided the whole family with financial support and maintained its thriving social life, the three sisters – Irina, Masha and Olga – are left all by themselves in their small town and their future is far from being bright. The family house, which used to be attended by renowned guests, now attracts merely eccentrics and outsiders. Soon, their brother dissipates the bequest and the necessity of earning their living makes them loose what aristocrats took for granted: free time. Their desire to live a happy and fuller life, their longing for love and for a new home leads the sisters into extreme situations. Bitter laughter, laughable tears – what seems to be ordinary fortunes of common people unlocks great stories of love and adversity. Three Sisters , one of the two plays that Anton Pavlovich Chekhov (1860–1904) wrote specifically for the Moscow Art Theater, is considered to be the Russian playwright’s masterpiece. The four-act drama had a significant impact on European theater, including the Czech one: performed by the Moscow ensemble in Prague in 1906 it revolutionized the local approach to modern acting and directing. In Brno, Three Sisters will be staged by Štěpán Pácl, in-house director of the Dramatic Company of the National Theater Brno, whose successful production of Chekhov’s play The Seagull was adapted into film.

The building of the Museum of Decorative Arts of the Moravian Gallery has received a new concept in 2021: ART DESIGN FASHION. It foreshadows that the museum is dedicated not only to design itself, but also to fashion and the relationship between design and art. Visitors can look forward to a permanent exhibition, exhibitions and new facilities prepared exclusively for the Moravian Gallery by leading Czech designers.

This multi-layered concept is unparalleled in the Czech Republic in terms of scope and quality.

The gallery involved Maxim Velčovský, Radek Wohlmuth and the edit! studio, Eva Eisler, David Karásek, the Olgoj Chorchoj studio and Marek Štěpán.

Marie Filippovová represents one of the most prominent figures on the Brno art scene. At first glance, her work impresses with its concentration, sense of rhythm, cyclicality and temporality.
