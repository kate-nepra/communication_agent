In the first year of their trade licence, everyone starts with the minimum health care contribution, regardless of the (expected) annual income. If you have a job as an employee and are using the trade licence for a secondary income, then you are not required to pay monthly advances. The contribution for the previous year depends on the total business profit. When your income tax return is being prepared you or your accountant will also calculate whether the minimum health care contributions were enough or whether you must pay extra. Also, based on the income from the previous year, you will be informed by your accountant of the new monthly health care contribution for the current year. The amount is determined by the profit achieved in the previous year. The assessment base for calculation of health insurance is 50% of the profit (gross income minus expenses equals profit). The health care contribution is 13.5% of the assessment base. In most cases – where the lump sum for expenses is 60% – this effectively amounts to about 2.7% of the income.

Where will the unveiling of the Dragon e4 Formula take place?,"Špilberk Castle, Brno, Czech Republic","[""There are several legends connected with the City of Brno. One of the best known is the Legend of the Brno Dragon. According to this legend, a terrible creature was terrorizing the citizens of Brno. The people had never seen this animal before, so they called it a dragon. They lived in fear of the dragon until one citizen managed to kill the monster by tricking it into eating a carcass filled with lime. In reality the dragon was a crocodile, the preserved body of which is now displayed at the entrance of the Old Town Hall. Crocodile and dragon motifs are common in Brno. A crocodile (Czech: krokodýl) is the local stuffed baguette, and the city radio station is known as Radio Krokodýl. The local baseball team is named Draci Brno (English: Brno Dragons) and the local rugby club is named RC Dragon Brno. There is also a local American football team called the Brno Alligators. An Intercity train connecting Brno and Prague is called Brněnský drak (English: The Brno dragon). Next to the 'dragon' at the Old Town Hall is the town's second well-known emblem, a wagon wheel made from a tree found and cut down 50 miles from the city. According to the legend, a local man made a wager that he could fell the tree, make a wheel out of it, and roll the wheel to the City of Brno, all within a single day. Since the achievement was deemed to be impossible by normal human means, the man was believed to have called on the devil for assistance, and died in poverty as a result. Another local legend relates to the siege of the city by Swedish forces in 1645. The locals and the Swedish army were in a stalemate, and the Swedish general declared that he would withdraw if his army had not won by noon. The bell ringer at Petrov Cathedral tricked him by ringing the bell an hour early, and keeping his word, the general and his army left. As a historic tribute to the event, the bell at Petrov Cathedral still rings for noon an hour earlier, at 11 o'clock. At this time, the Brno astronomical clock also releases a glass ball as a souvenir.\n\nLegends of Brno: The Dragon, the Crocodile, and the Wagon Wheel\nBrno is steeped in local legends, including the story of the Brno Dragon, actually a crocodile, defeated by a clever citizen. The city's emblematic crocodile motif extends to local culture, with culinary and sports references. Another tale involves a wager with the devil to roll a wagon wheel to Brno within a day, commemorated alongside the legend of outsmarting Swedish forces besieging the city.; url: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brno"", 'Your residence card should automatically come with an assigned personal “birth number” – rodné číslo . Most of the time, however, it is not issued within the same period (it is a different department of the Ministry of Interior) and is generated months later.

Begin in the centre and experience the famous Brno panorama from atop the tower of the Old Town Hall. It’s the ideal spot for a selfie with the Cathedral of Sts Peter and Paul in the background. Now head back to earth, and keep going, because you’re about to visit Brno’s Špilberk Castle. On the 50-minute guided tour of the Labyrinth under the Vegetable Market you’ll find out how the locals lived in medieval times. After the tour, carry on your walk over to the symbol of Brno: the Cathedral of Sts Peter and Paul. Below its walls you’ll find Denis Gardens, whose beauty it’d be mad to miss. From here, head back down to náměstí Svobody (Freedom Square), where stands Brno’s now legendary clock. From here it’s a stone’s throw to St James’ Church, where you’ll discover the second largest ossuary in Europe. After which you’ll have time to check out the four statues representing Plato’s cardinal virtues on Moravské náměstí (Moravian Square). Now you’ve criss-crossed Brno’s compact centre. And what would be a visit to Brno without a trip to Villa Tugendhat? You can buy BRNOPAS with admission to Villa Tugendhat online.

The monthly premium could be less than with the public insurance, but the coverage has lower limits at the same time.

If you have a job as an employee and are using the trade licence for a secondary income, then you are not required to pay monthly advances.

When your income tax return is being prepared you or your accountant will also calculate whether the minimum health care contributions were enough or whether you must pay extra. Also, based on the income from the previous year, you will be informed by your accountant of the new monthly health care contribution for the current year. The amount is determined by the profit achieved in the previous year. The assessment base for calculation of health insurance is 50% of the profit (gross income minus expenses equals profit). The health care contribution is 13.5% of the assessment base. In most cases – where the lump sum for expenses is 60% – this effectively amounts to about 2.7% of the income.
