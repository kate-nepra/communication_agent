2,What does public health insurance cover?,"['[""[\'The public health insurance covers all services that are intended to improve or maintain the health of the insured, or to alleviate his or her suffering. The insurance covers both ambulatory and institutional care, preventive care, the provision of medicines, drugs or medical devices, spa care and others. This healthcare is provided free of charge to you in a healthcare facility that has a contract with your health insurance provider. However, in the case of acute need for medical treatment, you may not be refused in a medical facility that does not have a contract. Only the basic material and treatment is paid in the case of dental treatment. Only a small part of healthcare is excluded from the health insurance, for example cosmetic surgery without any health reason.

There are basically no limits for the coverage of the medical expenses and the insurance company cannot cancel your insurance or refuse to extend it if you fulfill required conditions. This is different with the commercial health insurance. This insurance is not under such strict public control and gives insurance companies more room to benefit from the people insured. The monthly premium could be less than with the public insurance, but the coverage has lower limits at the same time. The doctors have more difficulties keeping the cost of medical services under the limits, and there is more paperwork for docs too. The biggest risk with the commercial health insurance is that the company can ditch the policy holder when he/she becomes too expensive and not extend the insurance when requested.\\\\nBrno, Czech Republic\\\\nHealth Insurance in the Czech Republic options\\\\nHealth insurance in the Czech Republic is a must-have for foreigners staying over 3 months.
