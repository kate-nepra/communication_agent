Brno later successfully defended itself from the Swedish under General Lennart Torstenson, led by Jean-Louis Raduit de Souches. After the war ended in 1648, Brno's status was confirmed by further imperial endorsements and the establishment of its bishopric in 1777. The 17th century also saw Špilberk Castle transform into a baroque citadel. The 19th century brought significant developments including the Battle of Austerlitz near Brno in 1805, the arrival of the first train from Vienna in 1839 marking the start of rail transport in the Czech Republic, and the commencement of tram services in 1869.

Brno was first mentioned in Cosmas\' Chronica Boemorum dated to the year 1091, when Bohemian king Vratislaus II besieged his brother Conrad at Brno castle. In the mid 11th century, Moravia was divided into three separate territories; each had its own ruler, coming from the Přemyslids dynasty, but independent of the other two, and subordinate only to the Bohemian ruler in Prague. The seats of these rulers and thus the ""capitals"" of these territories were the castles and towns of Brno, Olomouc, and Znojmo. In the late 12th century, Moravia began to reunify, forming the Margraviate of Moravia. From then until the mid of the 17th century, it was not clear which town should be the capital of Moravia. Political power was divided between Brno and Olomouc, but Znojmo also played an important role. The Moravian Diet, the Moravian Land Tables, and the Moravian Land Court were all seated in both cities at once. However, Brno was the official seat of the Moravian Margraves (rulers of Moravia), and later its geographical position closer to Vienna also became important. Otherwise, until 1642 Olomouc had a larger population than Brno, and was the seat of the only Roman Catholic diocese in Moravia. In 1243 Brno was granted the large and small city privileges by the King, and was thus recognized as a royal city. As throughout Eastern Central Europe, the granting of city privileges was connected with immigration from German-speaking lands. In 1324 Queen Elisabeth Richeza of Poland founded the Basilica of the Assumption of Our Lady, which now houses her grave. In the 14th century, Brno became one of the centres for the Moravian regional assemblies, whose meetings alternated between Brno and Olomouc. These assemblies made political, legal, and financial decisions. Brno and Olomouc were also the seats of the Land Court and the Moravian Land Tables, thus they were the two most important cities in Moravia. From the mid 14th century to the early 15th century, Špilberk Castle had served as the permanent seat of the Margraves of Moravia; one of them was elected the King of the Romans. Brno was besieged in 1428 and again in 1430 by the Hussites during the Hussite Wars.

Moreover, Brno serves as an international road transport crossroads with two motorways: the D1 leading to Ostrava and Prague, and the D2 to Bratislava. Close by is the D52 motorway to Vienna, and the planned D43 will link Brno to northwestern Moravia. The city is expanding its large ring road (road I/42), with several tunnels built and more planned. Initiatives to alleviate congestion include developing parking ramps, including underground options. Brno’s air transport features two airports: the international Brno–Tuřany Airport and the domestic Medlánky Airport, supporting activities like glider flights and hot air ballooning. Additionally, cycling is promoted due to the landscape, with a comprehensive network of trails and a long bikeway to Vienna.\nBrno, Czech Republic\nTransportation Infrastructure in Brno\nBrno boasts significant transportation infrastructure, serving as a major railway hub and a key node in international road transport with multiple motorways.

In the first year of their trade licence, everyone starts with the minimum health care contribution, regardless of the (expected) annual income. If you have a job as an employee and are using the trade licence for a secondary income, then you are not required to pay monthly advances. The contribution for the previous year depends on the total business profit. When your income tax return is being prepared you or your accountant will also calculate whether the minimum health care contributions were enough or whether you must pay extra. Also, based on the income from the previous year, you will be informed by your accountant of the new monthly health care contribution for the current year. The amount is determined by the profit achieved in the previous year. The assessment base for calculation of health insurance is 50% of the profit (gross income minus expenses equals profit). The health care contribution is 13.5% of the assessment base. In most cases – where the lump sum for expenses is 60% – this effectively amounts to about 2.7% of the income. If the actual assessment base is lower than the minimum calculation basis, then the health care contribution is set at the minimum monthly advance mentioned above.

One of the best known is the Legend of the Brno Dragon. According to this legend, a terrible creature was terrorizing the citizens of Brno. The people had never seen this animal before, so they called it a dragon. They lived in fear of the dragon until one citizen managed to kill the monster by tricking it into eating a carcass filled with lime. In reality the dragon was a crocodile, the preserved body of which is now displayed at the entrance of the Old Town Hall. Crocodile and dragon motifs are common in Brno. A crocodile (Czech: krokodýl) is the local stuffed baguette, and the city radio station is known as Radio Krokodýl. The local baseball team is named Draci Brno (English: Brno Dragons) and the local rugby club is named RC Dragon Brno. There is also a local American football team called the Brno Alligators. An Intercity train connecting Brno and Prague is called Brněnský drak (English: The Brno dragon). Next to the 'dragon' at the Old Town Hall is the town's second well-known emblem, a wagon wheel made from a tree found and cut down 50 miles from the city. According to the legend, a local man made a wager that he could fell the tree, make a wheel out of it, and roll the wheel to the City of Brno, all within a single day. Since the achievement was deemed to be impossible by normal human means, the man was believed to have called on the devil for assistance, and died in poverty as a result. Another local legend relates to the siege of the city by Swedish forces in 1645. The locals and the Swedish army were in a stalemate, and the Swedish general declared that he would withdraw if his army had not won by noon. The bell ringer at Petrov Cathedral tricked him by ringing the bell an hour early, and keeping his word, the general and his army left. As a historic tribute to the event, the bell at Petrov Cathedral still rings for noon an hour earlier, at 11 o'clock. At this time, the Brno astronomical clock also releases a glass ball as a souvenir.\n\nLegends of Brno: The Dragon, the Crocodile, and the Wagon Wheel\nBrno is steeped in local legends, including the story of the Brno Dragon, actually a crocodile, defeated by a clever citizen. The city's emblematic crocodile motif extends to local culture, with culinary and sports references. Another tale involves a wager with the devil to roll a wagon wheel to Brno within a day, commemorated alongside the legend of outsmarting Swedish forces besieging the city.; url: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brno"", 'Your residence card should automatically come with an assigned personal “birth number” – rodné číslo . Most of the time, however, it is not issued within the same period (it is a different department of the Ministry of Interior) and is generated months later. If you would like to learn that number, you have to get it from the Immigration office (MoI). They can tell you over the phone (974 801 801) if the number is ready or not. To learn the number, you have to visit the MoI in person and ask for “rodné číslo”, or send a request from your data mailbox, or send a request letter to the MoI office. If you didn’t get the address printed on your residence card, ask right away at the Immigration office to give you the stamp with the address into your passport. (It is not possible to get it at the Foreign police at Cejl) Another option is to apply via postal mail for “A certificate of current residence” .

Audience members become actors, using headphones for guidance, while they experience dramatized versions of real historical events based on Kaněrová's and Adamec's memories, set in a café.

Both born in 1934. Both students during the challenging 1950s in Czechoslovakia. Both classmates of Jana Horáková – the daughter of Milada Horáková, probably the most famous victim of communistic political monster-processes in Czechoslovakia.\nThanks to autoteatro, you might experience for a while what it felt like to be in their skin, and you will be able to imagine what they had to go through.\nWhat is Autoteatro? Autoteatro is a specific form of theater that engages participants in an immersive and interactive experience. In Autoteatro, individuals become both the actors and the audience, blurring the traditional boundaries between performer and spectator. Audience is entering the skin of protagonists of the play, becoming its main characters.\nAutoteatro takes place directly in a café during regular opening hours. Participants receive headphones through which they receive all the instructions. The experience is also guided by specially trained actors who enhance the overall atmosphere of the play.\nAbout the play Troublesome Classmates In the play Troublesome Classmates, you will immerse in the lives of two contemporaries of the communist revolution in Czechoslovakia – Jana Kaněrová and Zdeněk Adamec. They experienced the times of World War II, collectivization, and time of fabricated political trials. How do they remember that era? What was it like growing up in a time when one had to be a communist or face repressions that could cost one’s life?\nBoth Kaněrová and Adamec shared their memories with the Institute of National Memory. Students from JAMU (Janáček Academy of Performing Arts), under the guidance of Monika Okurková, transformed these memories into immersive theater for two spectators.\nFor each performance, we expect 2 participants, a man and a woman. They will sit at a table in a café (or a similar space), wearing headphones that will allow them to immerse in the story and take on the roles of Jana Kaněrová or Zdeněk Adamec, experiencing at least partially what they went through years ago.

"{'header': 'Mirandolina at Theatre Reduta', 'record_type': 'event', 'brief': '""Mirandolina"" is a play by Carlo Goldoni performed at Theatre Reduta, featuring a vivacious commedia dell’arte style filled with dynamic acting and opera singing. The story revolves around Mirandolina, the adept owner of an inn in Florence, juggling the attentions of various admirers with diverse intentions. The production employs sophisticated stage design and costume to enhance the viewer\'s experience.', 'text': 'Dominated by masterstrokes of vivacious acting, this dynamic commedia dell´arte gives the audience an intense theatrical experience crowned by astonishing numbers sung by both actors and opera singers. An incredibly sophisticated systems of backdrops and drapes enriches the spectators’ visual delight.\nThe peculiar owner of an inn in Florence, as we know her from Carlo Goldoni’s comedy, is a very competent woman who is more versed in business than anybody else. Both the pub and the rooms are always full and many clients long to win her affection. Some of them let it show rather ostentatiously, such as the impoverished yet boastful Marquis Di Forlipopoli and the upstart, self-centred Earl d’Albafiorit. Even though serving such importunate admirers might seem amusing, the lively innkeeper finds their obtuseness gruelling. Being a jovial person, she sits up and takes notice when baron Di Ripafratta – a sworn adversary of women – walks into her pub. Mirandolina is closely bound to the starring actress Tereza Groszmannová, whose translation of the play is custom-made both for herself and her fellow actors. The characters express themselves with a well-timed vigour, allowing dynamic acting.

Soon, their brother dissipates the bequest and the necessity of earning their living makes them loose what aristocrats took for granted: free time. Their desire to live a happy and fuller life, their longing for love and for a new home leads the sisters into extreme situations. Bitter laughter, laughable tears – what seems to be ordinary fortunes of common people unlocks great stories of love and adversity. Three Sisters, one of the two plays that Anton Pavlovich Chekhov (1860–1904) wrote specifically for the Moscow Art Theater, is considered to be the Russian playwright’s masterpiece. The four-act drama had a significant impact on European theater, including the Czech one: performed by the Moscow ensemble in Prague in 1906 it revolutionized the local approach to modern acting and directing. In Brno, Three Sisters will be staged by Štěpán Pácl, in-house director of the Dramatic Company of the National Theater Brno, whose successful production of Chekhov’s play The Seagull was adapted into film. Premiere: at Mahen Theater on October 27 th , 2023. Production team includes Anton Pavlovich Chekhov as the author, Jaroslav Vostrý for translation, and Štěpán Pácl for direction.

The author worked on the basis of personal experience with the collection of the Ethnographic Institute of the MFA. The direct contact with the documents of traditional folk culture, as well as the opportunity to look ""behind the mirror"", i.e. into the depositories of textiles, were subsequently reflected in his work. He was able to translate the floral motifs from costume embroidery into the plane of fashion and the carnation or tulip flowers thus acquired another dimension. This position is underlined by the colours in the basic tones of red - blue - white as a visual echo of the culture of the Moravian countryside. The accentuation of a simple, seemingly notorious detail evokes the message of the past, which the author has translated into the artistic language of today.

Getting to know Brno, for example! Right after you’ve got your accommodation sorted, head straight back out and start taking in the city’s wonders. Begin in the centre and experience the famous Brno panorama from atop the tower of the Old Town Hall. It’s the ideal spot for a selfie with the Cathedral of Sts Peter and Paul in the background. Now head back to earth, and keep going, because you’re about to visit Brno’s Špilberk Castle. On the 50-minute guided tour of the Labyrinth under the Vegetable Market you’ll find out how the locals lived in medieval times. After the tour, carry on your walk over to the symbol of Brno: the Cathedral of Sts Peter and Paul. Below its walls you’ll find Denis Gardens, whose beauty it’d be mad to miss. From here, head back down to náměstí Svobody (Freedom Square), where stands Brno’s now legendary clock. From here it’s a stone’s throw to St James’ Church, where you’ll discover the second largest ossuary in Europe. After which you’ll have time to check out the four statues representing Plato’s cardinal virtues on Moravské náměstí (Moravian Square). Now you’ve criss-crossed Brno’s compact centre. And what would be a visit to Brno without a trip to Villa Tugendhat? You can buy BRNOPAS with admission to Villa Tugendhat online. If Villa Tugendhat is not your cup of tea, try Villa Stiassni, with its blooming gardens and extravagant, almost chateau-like interiors. If you love Art Nouveau, you’d better go and see the Jurkovič Villa as well. The fourth leaf on this clover belongs to Villa Löw-Beer, where you can familiarize yourself with the city’s bourgeoisie at the turn of the 20th century. If you want a convenient ride to all four villas, check the timetable of the tourist minibus, which will take you to see the gardens of all four villas in the course of 2 hours. There’s a discount, too: with a BRNOPAS you’ll get 20% off. The price of a BRNOPAS for 1 day is CZK 290 for adults and CZK 190 for children up to and including 15 years. The price of a BRNOPAS for 1 day with Villa Tugendhat is CZK 690 for adults and CZK 440 for children.\n\n1 Day in Brno\nDiscover what to do in Brno within 24 hours, including visits to landmarks like the Old Town Hall tower, Špilberk Castle, and various villas.; url: https://www.gotobrno.cz/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/doBrna_EN_2023-web.pdf']","Registry offices in Brno provide various services such as higher verification of registration documents, updating registers, and issuing certificates.

1. Public health insurance: This is the standard form of health insurance in the Czech Republic and is mandatory for all residents. It is provided by a number of different insurance companies, but they all operate under the same system and offer similar coverage. The largest public health insurer is VZP (Všeobecná zdravotní pojišťovna), which covers the majority of the population. Public health insurance covers most medical services, including doctor visits, hospital stays, medications, and preventative care.
2. Private health insurance: This is an optional form of health insurance that can be purchased in addition to public health insurance. Private health insurance provides additional coverage for services that may not be covered by public health insurance, such as private rooms in hospitals, faster access to specialists, and alternative forms of medicine. Private health insurance is provided by a number of different companies and the cost and coverage vary depending on the provider.

It's important to note that private health insurance does not replace public health insurance, but rather supplements it. All residents of the Czech Republic are required to have public health insurance, and private health insurance is optional.","['All foreigners (non-EU) without permanent residency who reside in the CR on a long-term visa, long-term residency or temporary residency permit for any kind of purpose (study, do business, reunite with a family) are required to conclude the health insurance for settlement of medical expenses, for the minimum amount of EUR 400,000.

Applicants for the visa have to specify a purpose for their stay in the Czech Republic and apply for the appropriate visa at Embassy of the Czech Republic. The purpose of stay might be employment, business, scientific research, studies, family reunification, culture or other. The Czech Embassy is only authorized to receive an application for a long-term visa; the competent authority for processing it is the Ministry of Interior (MOI).

You can apply for a long-term visa for a purpose of family or a long-term residence for a purpose of family reunification.

However, a spouse or a child can apply for visa or residence permit at the same time with the person they are reunification with. You should file an application for a long-term visa at Embassy of the Czech Republic. For the complete list and requirements contact your local Czech embassy or visit the Immigration office website.
