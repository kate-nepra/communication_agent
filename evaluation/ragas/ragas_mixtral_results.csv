Audience members become actors, using headphones for guidance, while they experience dramatized versions of real historical events based on Kanƒõrov√°'s and Adamec's memories, set in a caf√©. The performance not only simulates personal experiences from a critical period in Czechoslovak history but also highlights the contemporary relevance of these past events."," I'm glad to assist you with information about Brno, Czech Republic!

Regarding your question, Autoteatro is not a theme or attraction related to the city of Brno. Instead, it seems to refer to an immersive theater format that originated in the United Kingdom. In this type of performance, audience members experience a show through pre-recorded audio played on headphones, rather than live actors on a stage.

9,What are the two types of health insurance available in the Czech Republic?,"['[[""""]]']",Public and commercial," In the Czech Republic, there are two main types of health insurance: public and private.

1. Public health insurance: This is the standard form of health insurance in the Czech Republic and is mandatory for all residents. It is provided by a number of different insurance companies, but they all operate under the same system and offer similar coverage. The largest public health insurer is VZP (V≈°eobecn√° zdravotn√≠ poji≈°≈•ovna), which covers the majority of the population. Public health insurance covers most medical services, including doctor visits, hospital stays, medications, and preventative care.
2. Private health insurance: This is an optional form of health insurance that can be purchased in addition to public health insurance. Private health insurance provides additional coverage for services that may not be covered by public health insurance, such as private rooms in hospitals, faster access to specialists, and alternative forms of medicine. Private health insurance is provided by a number of different companies and the cost and coverage vary depending on the provider.

It's important to note that private health insurance does not replace public health insurance, but rather supplements it. All residents of the Czech Republic are required to have public health insurance, and private health insurance is optional.",0.0,1.0,0.9901609406780464,0.0
