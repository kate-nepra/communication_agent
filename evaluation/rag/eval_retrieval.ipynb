Jewish presence in Brno dates back to the 13th century, with remnants of tombstones from as early as 1349. The functionalist synagogue, constructed between 1934 and 1936, stands as a testament to this heritage. Despite a Jewish population of 12,000 in 1938, only 1,000 survived Nazi persecution during World War II. Today, both the cemetery and synagogue are maintained by the Brno Jewish community. Additionally, Brno is home to the only Czech mosque, established in 1998. The interwar period witnessed a building boom in Brno, resulting in numerous modern and functionalist structures. Among the most celebrated is Villa Tugendhat, designed by architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe in the 1920s and designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2001. Another prominent architect, Arnošt Wiesner, significantly contributed to Brno's architectural landscape. Notable functionalist buildings include the Avion Hotel and Morava Palace. The Brno Exhibition Centre serves as a focal point for international business visitors, hosting over 40 professional trade fairs and conferences annually, attracting over one million visitors. Lužánky, established in the late 18th century, is the oldest public park in the Czech Republic, while Denis Gardens, founded in the early 19th century, represent the first public park established by public authorities in present-day Czech Republic. Špilberk Park, recognized as a national cultural sight, showcases unique landscape architecture. Among Brno's modern attractions is the Brno astronomical clock, while the AZ Tower, opened in 2013 and standing at 111 meters tall, holds the distinction of being the tallest building in the Czech Republic.

He was able to translate the floral motifs from costume embroidery into the plane of fashion and the carnation or tulip flowers thus acquired another dimension.

Autoteatro is a specific form of theater that engages participants in an immersive and interactive experience. In Autoteatro, individuals become both the actors and the audience, blurring the traditional boundaries between performer and spectator. Audience is entering the skin of protagonists of the play, becoming its main characters.\\\\nAutoteatro takes place directly in a café during regular opening hours. Participants receive headphones through which they receive all the instructions. The experience is also guided by specially trained actors who enhance the overall atmosphere of the play.\\\\nAbout the play Troublesome Classmates In the play Troublesome Classmates, you will immerse in the lives of two contemporaries of the communist revolution in Czechoslovakia – Jana Kaněrová and Zdeněk Adamec. They experienced the times of World War II, collectivization, and time of fabricated political trials. How do they remember that era? What was it like growing up in a time when one had to be a communist or face repressions that could cost one’s life?\\\\nBoth Kaněrová and Adamec shared their memories with the Institute of National Memory. Students from JAMU (Janáček Academy of Performing Arts), under the guidance of Monika Okurková, transformed these memories into immersive theater for two spectators.\\\\nFor each performance, we expect 2 participants, a man and a woman. They will sit at a table in a café (or a similar space), wearing headphones that will allow them to immerse in the story and take on the roles of Jana Kaněrová or Zdeněk Adamec, experiencing at least partially what they went through years ago.

Autoteatro is a specific form of theater that engages participants in an immersive and interactive experience. In Autoteatro, individuals become both the actors and the audience, blurring the traditional boundaries between performer and spectator. Audience is entering the skin of protagonists of the play, becoming its main characters.\\\\nAutoteatro takes place directly in a café during regular opening hours. Participants receive headphones through which they receive all the instructions. The experience is also guided by specially trained actors who enhance the overall atmosphere of the play.\\\\nAbout the play Troublesome Classmates In the play Troublesome Classmates, you will immerse in the lives of two contemporaries of the communist revolution in Czechoslovakia – Jana Kaněrová and Zdeněk Adamec. They experienced the times of World War II, collectivization, and time of fabricated political trials. How do they remember that era? What was it like growing up in a time when one had to be a communist or face repressions that could cost one’s life?\\\\nBoth Kaněrová and Adamec shared their memories with the Institute of National Memory. Students from JAMU (Janáček Academy of Performing Arts), under the guidance of Monika Okurková, transformed these memories into immersive theater for two spectators.\\\\nFor each performance, we expect 2 participants, a man and a woman. They will sit at a table in a café (or a similar space), wearing headphones that will allow them to immerse in the story and take on the roles of Jana Kaněrová or Zdeněk Adamec, experiencing at least partially what they went through years ago.

Being a jovial person, she sits up and takes notice when baron Di Ripafratta – a sworn adversary of women – walks into her pub. Mirandolina is closely bound to the starring actress Tereza Groszmannová, whose translation of the play is custom-made both for herself and her fellow actors. The characters express themselves with a well-timed vigour, allowing dynamic acting.

What was it like growing up in a time when one had to be a communist or face repressions that could cost one’s life?\\\\nBoth Kaněrová and Adamec shared their memories with the Institute of National Memory.

But maybe at some other place or at some other time … After the decease of their father, who provided the whole family with financial support and maintained its thriving social life, the three sisters – Irina, Masha and Olga – are left all by themselves in their small town and their future is far from being bright. The family house, which used to be attended by renowned guests, now attracts merely eccentrics and outsiders. Soon, their brother dissipates the bequest and the necessity of earning their living makes them loose what aristocrats took for granted: free time. Their desire to live a happy and fuller life, their longing for love and for a new home leads the sisters into extreme situations. Bitter laughter, laughable tears – what seems to be ordinary fortunes of common people unlocks great stories of love and adversity. Three Sisters, one of the two plays that Anton Pavlovich Chekhov (1860–1904) wrote specifically for the Moscow Art Theater, is considered to be the Russian playwright’s masterpiece. The four-act drama had a significant impact on European theater, including the Czech one: performed by the Moscow ensemble in Prague in 1906 it revolutionized the local approach to modern acting and directing.

Despite the fact that it is a collection of masterful replicas, facsimiles, maquettes and models, it was very difficult to procure them for the exhibition. To secure all the exhibits, we connected with experts not only from several European countries, but also from the USA, India, Australia, Honduras and China. Probably the most valuable exhibit of the exhibition is a 1:1 replica of the famous Mitchell-Hedges crystal skull. The exhibit is, like the original, precisely cut from a single crystal of natural crystal.

Autoteatro is a specific form of theater that engages participants in an immersive and interactive experience. In Autoteatro, individuals become both the actors and the audience, blurring the traditional boundaries between performer and spectator. Audience is entering the skin of protagonists of the play, becoming its main characters.\\\\nAutoteatro takes place directly in a café during regular opening hours. Participants receive headphones through which they receive all the instructions. The experience is also guided by specially trained actors who enhance the overall atmosphere of the play.\\\\nAbout the play Troublesome Classmates In the play Troublesome Classmates, you will immerse in the lives of two contemporaries of the communist revolution in Czechoslovakia – Jana Kaněrová and Zdeněk Adamec. They experienced the times of World War II, collectivization, and time of fabricated political trials. How do they remember that era? What was it like growing up in a time when one had to be a communist or face repressions that could cost one’s life?\\\\nBoth Kaněrová and Adamec shared their memories with the Institute of National Memory. Students from JAMU (Janáček Academy of Performing Arts), under the guidance of Monika Okurková, transformed these memories into immersive theater for two spectators.\\\\nFor each performance, we expect 2 participants, a man and a woman. They will sit at a table in a café (or a similar space), wearing headphones that will allow them to immerse in the story and take on the roles of Jana Kaněrová or Zdeněk Adamec, experiencing at least partially what they went through years ago.

Now head back to earth, and keep going, because you’re about to visit Brno’s Špilberk Castle. On the 50-minute guided tour of the Labyrinth under the Vegetable Market you’ll find out how the locals lived in medieval times. After the tour, carry on your walk over to the symbol of Brno: the Cathedral of Sts Peter and Paul. Below its walls you’ll find Denis Gardens, whose beauty it’d be mad to miss. From here, head back down to náměstí Svobody (Freedom Square), where stands Brno’s now legendary clock. From here it’s a stone’s throw to St James’ Church, where you’ll discover the second largest ossuary in Europe. After which you’ll have time to check out the four statues representing Plato’s cardinal virtues on Moravské náměstí (Moravian Square). Now you’ve criss-crossed Brno’s compact centre. And what would be a visit to Brno without a trip to Villa Tugendhat? You can buy BRNOPAS with admission to Villa Tugendhat online. If Villa Tugendhat is not your cup of tea, try Villa Stiassni, with its blooming gardens and extravagant, almost chateau-like interiors. If you love Art Nouveau, you’d better go and see the Jurkovič Villa as well. The fourth leaf on this clover belongs to Villa Löw-Beer, where you can familiarize yourself with the city’s bourgeoisie at the turn of the 20th century. If you want a convenient ride to all four villas, check the timetable of the tourist minibus, which will take you to see the gardens of all four villas in the course of 2 hours. There’s a discount, too: with a BRNOPAS you’ll get 20% off. The price of a BRNOPAS for 1 day is CZK 290 for adults and CZK 190 for children up to and including 15 years.

The health care contribution is 13.5% of the assessment base. In most cases – where the lump sum for expenses is 60% – this effectively amounts to about 2.7% of the income.

The purpose of stay might be employment, business, scientific research, studies, family reunification, culture or other. The Czech Embassy is only authorized to receive an application for a long-term visa; the competent authority for processing it is the Ministry of Interior (MOI).

You can apply for a long-term visa for a purpose of family or a long-term residence for a purpose of family reunification. An application for a long-term visa or residence for the purpose of family reunification can primarily be filed by a foreign national who is a spouse or a child of a foreign national (nonEU) who is already in possession of a long-term residence (i.e. employee card) or permanent residence permit in the Czech Republic. However, a spouse or a child can apply for visa or residence permit at the same time with the person they are reunification with.
